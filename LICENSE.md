**By accessing or using any content on QNFO.org (including text, code, data, theories, images, and concepts - collectively, the “Content”), you agree to these terms in full.** Please read them carefully.

---

**1. Purpose and License Grant**
    1.1. **Goal:** We provide this Content primarily for non-commercial research, education, and activities that promote social good and ethical innovation.
    1.2. **Permission:** We (Rowan Brad Quni, the “Licensor” as further defined in Section 6) grant you (“You”) a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license** to use the Content **for non-commercial purposes only**, as defined in Section 4.1.

**2. Permitted Uses**
    2.1. Subject to the terms herein, You are encouraged to use the Content for purposes such as:
        a. Personal study and learning.
        b. Academic research and publications.
        c. Educational purposes (e.g., teaching, presentations).
        d. Projects aimed at social, environmental, or humanitarian benefit.
        e. Creating derivative works, provided they are also shared under similar non-commercial terms and give proper attribution as required by Section 3.

**3. Core Responsibilities**
    3.1. **Attribution:** If You use, adapt, or refer to the Content in *any* published or publicly shared work (including but not limited to academic papers, articles, books, presentations, software, websites, patents, technical reports, etc.), You **must clearly attribute** it. Include a statement substantially similar to: “This work incorporates or builds upon material from QNFO.org (Rowan Brad Quni), available under the QNFO Content License Agreement v1.1 at https://qnfo.org/LICENSE.”
    3.2. **Indication of Changes:** If You modify the Content when creating a derivative work, You must include a statement indicating that changes were made to the original Content.
    3.3. **Ethical Use:** You may not use the Content in any way that violates applicable laws, infringes on the rights of others, promotes discrimination or violence, harms ecosystems, involves exploitative practices, or is otherwise broadly considered unethical within scientific and humanitarian communities.

**4. Restrictions**
    4.1. **Non-Commercial Use:** You **may not** use the Content for commercial purposes. “Commercial purposes” include, but are not limited to:
        a. Selling, renting, licensing, or sublicensing the Content or derivative works.
        b. Using the Content in any product, service, or platform where the Content itself is a primary component for generating revenue (e.g., through paid access, subscriptions, or advertising directly tied to the Content).
        c. Using the Content in a way primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
    4.2. **Patent Prior Art Citation:** If You, or any entity You represent, develop any invention or file any patent application anywhere in the world that was influenced by, incorporates, or is derived from the Content, You **must explicitly cite QNFO.org (Rowan Brad Quni, ORCID: 0009-0002-4317-5604) as prior art** in the patent application and related documentation. Failure to disclose known prior art can affect patent validity under various national laws (e.g., 35 U.S.C. § 102 in the US, EPC Article 54 in Europe, Patent Law Article 22 in China). Compliance with this clause is a material term of this license.

**5. Breach and Consequences**
    5.1. **Unauthorized Commercial Use (Liquidated Damages):** If You breach Section 4.1 by using the Content for commercial purposes, You agree that actual damages would be difficult to quantify. Therefore, You agree to pay Licensor liquidated damages equal to **eighty-five percent (85%) of all gross revenue** or equivalent economic value derived directly or indirectly from such unauthorized commercial use. This amount is agreed upon as a reasonable pre-estimate of the damages incurred by Licensor due to the breach of the non-commercial terms, not as a penalty.
    5.2. **Patent Misuse Consequences:** Failure to comply with the prior art citation requirement in Section 4.2 constitutes a material breach of this license. In addition to potential impacts on patent validity under applicable law, Licensor reserves the right to pursue remedies for breach of contract, which may include damages and legal costs.
    5.3. **License Termination:** This license and the permissions granted herein will **terminate automatically** upon any breach by You of these terms. Upon termination, You must immediately cease all use of the Content and destroy any copies or derivative works in Your possession or control.
    5.4. **Enforcement:** Licensor reserves the right to pursue all available legal and equitable remedies to enforce these terms.

**6. Intellectual Property Ownership and Licensor Identity**
    6.1. **Licensor Identification:** For the purposes of this Agreement, the “Licensor” is **Rowan Brad Quni** (ORCID: 0009-0002-4317-5604).
    6.2. **Name Clarification:** For avoidance of doubt, Licensor Rowan Brad Quni was previously known legally and professionally as **Bradley James Gudzinas**.

    6.3. **Ownership Retention:** Licensor retains **all ownership rights**, title, and interest, including copyright and other intellectual property rights, in and to the Content, regardless of the name under which such rights were originally secured or filed.

    7.2. **Dispute Resolution:** Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its breach, termination, or validity, shall be resolved exclusively through **binding arbitration in Geneva, Switzerland**. The arbitration shall be conducted in English under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in effect at the time of the arbitration. The parties agree that the arbitral award shall be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This clause is intended to facilitate efficient resolution and international enforcement (e.g., under the New York Convention).

    8.3. **Indemnification:** You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to (a) Your use or misuse of the Content, or (b) Your violation of any term of this Agreement.

**9. General Provisions**
    9.1. **Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, or severed if modification is not possible, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
