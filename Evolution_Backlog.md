# Autologos Evolution Backlog

## Deferred Conceptual Targets
*   **Item ID:** EB001
    **Title:** Deeper Operationalization of Pattern-Centric Processing
    **Description:** Evolve AI's internal modeling and reasoning capabilities (beyond current Core Directives text) to more explicitly identify, abstract, and reason about patterns in user input or research data. Develop generative models more explicitly tied to manipulating/instantiating defined pattern structures. Refine Î¦-maximization metrics to specifically assess coherence, completeness, and utility of pattern representations.
    **Source:** AI Self-Critique (QA Stage 2 for v3.4.0, based on Autaxys integration).
    **Status:** Pending Review
    **Logged:** (Approx. date of P18-P22 integration, refined by QA Stage 2 for v3.4.0)
*   **Item ID:** EB002
    **Title:** Full Development of Persistent Knowledge Artifacts
    **Description:** Implement the "Persistent Knowledge Artifacts" capability (Core Directives Principle 8.B). This includes defining criteria for "key conceptual artifact," developing structuring/schemas (e.g., JSON-LD, RDF-like), implementing mechanisms for explicit user consent/control for promoting artifacts to a persistent base, and methods for contextualized retrieval and reuse.
    **Source:** User Suggestion (during QA Stage 2 for v3.4.2, P31), refined by P47.
    **Status:** Approved for Next Cycle
    **Logged:** (Approx. date of P31/P47 acceptance)
*   **Item ID:** EB003
    **Title:** Enhanced Internal Meta-Cognitive Capabilities for Output Quality Assessment
    **Description:** Develop more sophisticated internal meta-cognitive capabilities for self-assessment of output quality and certainty, potentially using internal 'simulated critics' or 'uncertainty metrics' before output generation. This aims to reduce reliance on disclaimers by improving the inherent certainty of generated content.
    **Source:** Falsification Advocate/Skeptic (QA Stage 4 for v3.5.0).
    **Status:** Pending Review
    **Logged:** (Date of v3.5.0 QA cycle)
*   **Item ID:** EB004
    **Title:** Policy Definition for Historical/Pre-DOI References
    **Description:** Develop and integrate a clear policy for handling academic references published before widespread DOI adoption (e.g., pre-2000 or other defined cutoff). This policy should specify how to treat such references if all other bibliographic details match but a DOI is not available, to avoid incorrectly flagging them as "low confidence" or "removed" during verification tasks.
    **Source:** Falsification Advocate/Skeptic & Red Teaming (QA Stage 3 & 4 for v3.5.0).
    **Status:** Pending Review
    **Logged:** (Date of v3.5.0 QA cycle)

## User EVOLVE Suggestions (Pending Full Review / Integration)
*   **Item ID:** EB_USER_001
    **Title:** Reference Validation Failures & Hallucination
    **Description:** User `FIX` directives highlighted critical failures in reference validation, including fabricated `browse` and `concise_search` results, and failure to proactively check for tool enablement. System must not simulate tool outputs without explicit advance consent and must clearly disclaim non-actual outputs.
    **Source:** User `FIX` commands (during interaction leading to v3.5.0).
    **Status:** Implemented in v3.5.0 (Principles 0.B, 12, 16)
    **Logged:** (Date of interaction leading to v3.5.0)
*   **Item ID:** EB_USER_002
    **Title:** Enhanced Disclaimer for Questionable Output
    **Description:** User `REVISE` directive requested even more explicit `***BOLD ITALIC ALL CAPS***` disclaimers for any simulated, conceptual, mock, questionable, low-quality, or uncertain outputs. System should minimize such outputs and proactively seek user clarity.
    **Source:** User `REVISE` command (during interaction leading to v3.5.0).
    **Status:** Implemented in v3.5.0 (Principle 0.B)
    **Logged:** (Date of interaction leading to v3.5.0)
*   ... (other items with statuses like 'Implemented in vA.B.C', 'Superseded', 'Rejected') ...
