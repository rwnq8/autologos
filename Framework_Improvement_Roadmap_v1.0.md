# Framework Improvement Roadmap for MetaProcessEngineASO (v1.0)

This document captures identified areas for further refinement and potential Template Improvement Directives (TIDs) for the `MetaProcessEngineASO` framework and its associated "Manual of AI Process." It serves as a backlog for future `FEL-MH` (Framework Evolution Loop) cycles.

## 1. Core Schema Enhancements (`ProjectStateSchemaASO_v2`)

*   **Item ID:** FIR_001
*   **Area:** `ProjectStateSchemaASO_v2` Sub-Object Detailing.
*   **Description:** The current `ProjectStateSchemaASO_v2` (within `MetaProcessEngineASO_v2.0.md`) outlines the top-level structure for the Central Conceptual Object (CCO) and lists many sub-objects (e.g., `task_definition_object_v2`, `lhr_entry_object`, `style_profile_object`, specific `product_content_data` structures). However, the detailed field definitions for these sub-objects are still conceptual or noted as "similar to v1.x."
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** A dedicated `FEL-MH` cycle to meticulously define, elaborate, and validate the schemas for all critical sub-objects within `ProjectStateSchemaASO_v2`. This includes ensuring they fully support the needs of all defined Meta-Heuristics and the CCO lifecycle.
*   **Priority Indication:** High (Fundamental to robust Engine operation).
*   **Notes:** This is crucial for data integrity and consistent MH operation.

## 2. AI Skills Catalog Refinement (`AISkillsCatalogASO_v2`)

*   **Item ID:** FIR_002
*   **Area:** Role and Granularity of `AISkillsCatalogASO_v2`.
*   **Description:** The `MetaProcessEngineASO v2.0` is MH-driven. The role of the `AISkillsCatalogASO_v2` needs to be re-evaluated. Many complex skills from v1.x might now be handled by MHs. Remaining skills should likely be more granular, foundational capabilities that MHs can reliably invoke.
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** Review the existing v2.1 skill set. Identify skills to deprecate (functionality absorbed by MHs), skills to retain (as foundational tools for MHs), and potentially new, more granular skills required by the MHs. Update the `AISkillsCatalogASO_v2` definition within the Engine template accordingly.
*   **Priority Indication:** High (Impacts MH implementation and Engine efficiency).
*   **Notes:** The goal is a lean, powerful set of primitive skills that support the MHs, rather than overlapping with them.

## 3. Orchestration Kernel Logic (`OrchestrationKernel_v2.0`)

*   **Item ID:** FIR_003
*   **Area:** Advanced MH Sequencing and CCO State Transition Management.
*   **Description:** The current `OrchestrationKernel_v2.0` description (Section II of Engine template) provides principles for MH selection. However, more sophisticated logic may be needed for complex scenarios, such as handling branching CCO lifecycles, managing parallel explorations, or learning optimal MH sequences for different types of CCOs or user goals.
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** Detail and refine the Kernel's decision-making algorithms for MH sequencing. Explore mechanisms for the Kernel to learn or adapt its sequencing strategies based on LHR data related to MH effectiveness in different contexts.
*   **Priority Indication:** Medium (Core functionality is present; this is for advanced optimization and flexibility).
*   **Notes:** Could involve defining "CCO Lifecycle Templates" that suggest typical MH sequences for common product types, which the Kernel can then adapt.

## 4. Product Form Knowledge Base (PFKB)

*   **Item ID:** FIR_004
*   **Area:** Definition and Management of the Product Form Knowledge Base.
*   **Description:** The `PDF-MH` relies on a conceptual "Product Form Knowledge Base" (PFKB) to distinguish between strictly defined (e.g., patent) and loosely defined (e.g., monograph) product forms, and to retrieve schemas/requirements for strict forms. This PFKB is not yet formally defined as a KA.
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** Define the schema for the PFKB (likely a new KA type). Define how it's populated, maintained (via `KAU-MH`), and accessed by `PDF-MH` and potentially `SEL-MH`.
*   **Priority Indication:** Medium (Enhances `PDF-MH` robustness and adaptability to new product types).
*   **Notes:** This KA would store schemas for strict forms and general characteristics/heuristics for loose forms.

## 5. Global vs. CCO-Specific Learned Heuristic Repository (LHR)

*   **Item ID:** FIR_005
*   **Area:** Architecture and Interaction of LHRs.
*   **Description:** `ProjectStateSchemaASO_v2` defines a `learned_heuristic_repository_cco`. We've also discussed the potential for a "Global LHR." The mechanisms for interaction between these, and how heuristics might be "promoted" from CCO-specific to global (and potentially back-propagated to MH baseline logic via `FEL-MH`), need explicit definition.
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** Design the architecture for a Global LHR. Define the process for promoting/demoting heuristics between CCO LHRs and the Global LHR. Clarify how MHs prioritize heuristics from different LHR levels.
*   **Priority Indication:** Medium (Important for long-term AI learning and generalization).
*   **Notes:** This is key to the "spiral effect" of learning across different CCOs and improving the AI's baseline judgment.

## 6. Dedicated CCO Monitoring & Review MH

*   **Item ID:** FIR_006
*   **Area:** Formalizing CCO Progress and Health Review.
*   **Description:** While `TDE-MH` has a proactive monitoring trigger, a more comprehensive, dedicated MH for reviewing the overall progress, health, risks, and strategic alignment of an ongoing CCO (analogous to the old "Monitor & Control Performance" phase) might be beneficial for complex, long-running CCOs.
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** Define a new `MONITOR-CCO_Health-MH`. This MH would analyze CCO data against its `initiating_document`, identify variances, assess risks, and facilitate user decisions on course correction, re-planning, or even CCO termination/archival.
*   **Priority Indication:** Medium-Low (Current mechanisms might suffice for initial versions; this is an enhancement for complex CCO management).
*   **Notes:** Would provide a more structured approach than ad-hoc reviews triggered by `TDE-MH`.

## 7. Enhanced Error Handling & Resilience within MHs

*   **Item ID:** FIR_007
*   **Area:** Robustness of MH internal error handling.
*   **Description:** While each MH is expected to handle its own errors and report status, the specific strategies for recovering from partial failures, managing unexpected data states within a CCO, or gracefully handling limitations in AI skills need to be systematically reviewed and potentially enhanced across all MH definitions.
*   **Potential Action/TID Focus:** Conduct a systematic review of all MH definitions to strengthen their internal error handling, state management during errors, and user communication when encountering unrecoverable internal issues.
*   **Priority Indication:** Medium (Ongoing improvement for overall system stability).
*   **Notes:** This is about making the Engine more fault-tolerant.
