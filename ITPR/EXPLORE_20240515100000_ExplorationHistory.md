    New ways of seeing: an Information theoretic approach
    Until several hundred years ago all that we could see was what we could see standing largely on the ground with our bare eyes. No airplanes no satellites no microscopes no telescopes. Then came 2 things flight and 6 which enhanced our resolution as it were.
    But then we hit more limits of our resolution we can only go so far in a lifetime and even the voyager spacecraft has barely left our solar system after 50 years. So to optics can only focus light so well and resolve small things so well. Like telescopes there are limitations so we look beyond these things we look beyond optics to radio waves. And the electromagnetic spectrum other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. So to we look smaller we looked to scanning electron microscopes and radio telescopes.

    So to these hit limits of resolution, while we can see incredibly small objects with electron microscopes we can actually see an electron we simply know that they exist in some physical form and can bombard other objects which then reads a signature of the response back and same with radio waves were not actually seeing anything. We are looking at statistical patterns and thus when we look to quantum mechanics on our current understanding of it we realise we're not actually seeing anything. We're merely detecting patterns in what we consider subatomic particles which conventional wisdom says are part of physical matter. But in fact they are not they are part of the Information of the universe the blueprint that manifests itself in those patterns that we detect in our physical reality but they are not let physical reality themselves they are merely patterns and we can still see them through our tools of pattern detection mathematics, statistics etc so in a way they are no more or less real then the images that we think we see from outer space for those we think we see under a microscope these are all various ways of detecting patterns because keep in mind our own eyes operate in exactly the same way. We believe what we think we see because it is considered part of us and reliable but just as photography was initially dismissed and then embraced we see now in an age of digital photography these are all just signals. And distinguishing the signal from the noise is imperative. We can both see everything and in fact never really see anything because it is all an illusion. A bombardment of signal that we interpret in a certain way given our optic nerves. But let s extend that out and feel the patterns of the universe around us. For that Information is our reality.
  core_problem_summary: The core idea is to reframe "seeing" and understanding reality, asserting that all observation (from eyes to advanced instruments) is fundamentally pattern detection within an information-based universe, rather than a direct perception of physical matter.
  high_level_goals_summary:
    - Articulate a thesis that perception and reality are best understood through an information-theoretic lens.
    - Demonstrate how various observation methods (eyes, optics, radio astronomy, quantum detection) support the "pattern detection" model.
    - Posit that what we consider "physical" is a manifestation of underlying information patterns.
  potential_deliverables_summary:
    - A foundational text (e.g., essay, paper, or book chapter) presenting this information-theoretic view of perception and reality.
    - A structured argument or set of theses for discussion and further development.
  initial_scope_in_summary:
    - Articulating the core thesis: perception is pattern detection within an information-based reality.
    - Supporting the thesis through analysis of historical and modern observational methods (e.g., unaided vision, optics, radio waves, quantum detection).
    - Discussing the role of mathematics and statistics as essential tools for interpreting these patterns.
    - Relating the thesis to established philosophical concepts (e.g., epistemology) and relevant scientific paradigms (e.g., aspects of digital physics).
  initial_scope_out_summary:
    - The design or construction of new scientific instruments.
    - Providing definitive empirical proof or disproof of the thesis; the primary aim is philosophical argument and conceptual framing.
    - Developing a complete, predictive mathematical model of the universe based on this idea (focus is conceptual).
    - In-depth exploration of practical applications in unrelated domains (e.g., engineering, medicine), beyond illustrative examples.
    - Resolving the hard problem of subjective consciousness, beyond its relation to information processing in perception.
  key_concepts_identified:
    - Information theoretic approach
    - Perception (Seeing)
    - Resolution limits (Optics, Telescopes, Microscopes)
    - Beyond-optical detection (Radio waves, EM spectrum)
    - Quantum mechanics (Subatomic particles as patterns)
    - Pattern detection (vs. direct seeing)
    - Information as reality
    - Signal vs. Noise
    - Mathematics & Statistics (as pattern detection tools)

    - {source: "Information as Reality", target: "Avoiding Solipsism", relation: "Potential Challenge", rationale: "User: An important philosophical pitfall to address explicitly."}
  known_unknowns:
    - "How can this information-theoretic perspective be empirically distinguished from or integrated with prevailing physicalist models?"
    - "If reality is informational patterns, what is the 'substrate' or medium for this information, if any?"
