exploration_history:
  session_id: "ITPR_RESET_EXPLORE"
  initial_user_prompt: |
    Project reset initiated. Entire preceding dialogue (including original ITPR exploration, Autologos development, critique of physicality, four-pillar structure, etc.) serves as the comprehensive exploration input for this new project definition. Key documents provided by user ('Infomatics.md', 'Lineage of Information-Based Physics.md', 'Comparing Fundamental Frameworks.md') are part of this input.
  core_problem_summary: "Current scientific/philosophical paradigms (materialism, naive realism) are inadequate to coherently explain reality, especially at the frontiers of physics and in understanding perception. This leads to paradoxes and the reification of 'knowledge voids.' A new foundational principle is needed to account for reality as a self-generating, pattern-based system."
  high_level_goals_summary:
    - "Develop and articulate a new ontological framework based on 'Autologos' as the fundamental, self-generating, rational principle of reality."
    - "Demonstrate how this framework provides more coherent explanations for perception, 'physicality,' quantum phenomena, and cosmological enigmas, using the 'Four Pillars' (Phenomena, Tools, Methods, Frameworks) argumentative approach."
    - "Critique limitations of physicalism/materialism."
    - "Produce a 'monumental tract' (monograph D001) presenting this worldview."
    - "(Meta-Goal) Refine AI-assisted project management and content generation processes."
  potential_deliverables_summary:
    - "D001: Monograph ('A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autologos' - working title)."
    - "KA001: ITPR_AutologosPrimer."
    - "KA002: ITPR_Glossary."
  initial_scope_in_summary:
    - "Philosophical argumentation, conceptual analysis, reinterpretation of scientific concepts (physics, perception), development of Autologos framework, critique of materialism, 'Four Pillars' methodology."
  initial_scope_out_summary:
    - "New mathematical formalisms for Autologos (beyond conceptual), definitive empirical proof (at this stage), detailed theological engagement, solving Hard Problem of consciousness directly."
  key_concepts_identified: ["Autologos", "Perception (as pattern detection)", "Pattern", "Physicality (critique & redefinition)", "Matter (emergent)", "Physical Laws (emergent)", "Knowledge Void", "Direct Observation (critique)", "Map vs. Territory", "Quantum Mechanics (reinterpretation)", "Materialism (critique)", "Four Pillars (Phenomena, Tools, Methods, Frameworks)", "Rock-Neutrino-Photon-Gravity Spectrum", "Instrumental Spectrum"]
