version: "2.0"
status: "Formalized"
date_formalized: "[AI_DATE_GENERATION_PROHIBITED]"
project_summary: "This project aims to develop and articulate a new ontological framework centered on 'Autologos' â€“ a fundamental, self-generating, self-structuring, and self-articulating rational principle of reality. It will demonstrate how this framework provides coherent explanations for perception (as active pattern detection), 'physicality' (as emergent from Autologos-generated patterns), and phenomena in quantum mechanics and cosmology, thereby critiquing and offering an alternative to prevailing materialist/physicalist ontologies and naive realism. The primary deliverable is a monograph tentatively titled 'A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autologos.'"
project_vision: "To establish 'Autologos' as a compelling and transformative foundational principle for understanding reality, perception, and science, significantly contributing to philosophical and scientific discourse, and positioning the primary written work as a 'monumental tract' that redefines our engagement with the universe."

scope_in:
  - "Development of the Autologos concept as a fundamental ontological principle."
  - "Philosophical argumentation and conceptual analysis."
  - "Critique of materialism, physicalism, and naive realism regarding perception and reality."
  - "Reinterpretation of established scientific concepts and observations from physics (quantum mechanics, cosmology, particle physics) and perception science through the Autologos framework."

  - "Iterative refinement of project management templates and AI operational protocols based on project experience."
scope_out:
  - "Development of new, predictive mathematical formalisms or equations for Autologos dynamics (focus is conceptual and philosophical at this stage)."
  - "Providing definitive empirical proof or experimental falsification of the Autologos thesis (focus is on conceptual coherence, explanatory power, and reinterpretation of existing knowledge)."
  - "Detailed engagement with specific historical theological interpretations of 'Logos' beyond brief etymological/contextual notes for 'Autologos'."
  - "Attempting to definitively solve the 'Hard Problem' of subjective consciousness (though its relation to an Autologos framework may be discussed)."

  - "The primary output (D001) is a written philosophical/scientific monograph."
  - "Timeline for completion is TBD in planning but aims for thoroughness over speed."
  - "AI capabilities are as defined in the AISkillsCatalog and current operational protocols; AI cannot generate novel scientific discoveries or unprompted philosophical breakthroughs beyond synthesizing and developing user-provided concepts."
high_level_risks:
  - id: "R001"
    description: "Conceptual Complexity of Autologos: The 'Autologos' concept may prove too abstract, difficult to define with sufficient precision, or challenging for readers to grasp, potentially leading to misinterpretation or perceived lack of rigor."
    mitigation: "Develop a clear Autologos Primer (KA001) and Glossary (KA002). Use extensive illustrative examples in D001. Iterative refinement of definitions and explanations based on Author feedback."
  - id: "R002"
    description: "Resistance to Paradigm Challenge: The thesis fundamentally challenges established paradigms (materialism, physicalism); may face strong skepticism or dismissal from adherents of current views."
    mitigation: "Ensure arguments are philosophically rigorous, well-supported by reinterpretation of accepted scientific observations, and address potential counter-arguments proactively. Focus on explanatory power and coherence."
  - id: "R003"
    description: "Scope Creep: The ambitious nature of the project (reinterpreting foundational aspects of reality) may lead to unmanageable scope creep into too many areas of science or philosophy."
    mitigation: "Strict adherence to the defined 'Scope In' and 'Scope Out'. Regular review of D001 development against the Charter and Plan. Prioritize core arguments."
  - id: "R004"
    description: "Terminological Instability: The core ontological term ('Autologos') or other key terminology might require further revision, causing significant rework."
    mitigation: "Dedicated sub-project (SP002) to finalize 'Autologos' was undertaken. Maintain active KAs (Primer, Glossary) and review terminology choices at key milestones."
  - id: "R005"
    description: "AI Misalignment: AI may misinterpret complex instructions or fail to capture the intended nuance in drafting, requiring extensive author correction."
    mitigation: "Iterative review of AI-generated content in manageable chunks. Clear, specific prompting. Continuous refinement of AI operational protocols and Collab Guide based on feedback (Goal G007)."
