# Version: 1.2
# Date: [AI_DATE_GENERATION_PROHIBITED]

guidelines:
  - style_id: "SG001"
    category: "Tone & Voice (General)"
    specification: |
      The primary tone for D001 (Monograph) should be academic, philosophical, analytical, and rigorous, yet accessible and engaging for an intelligent lay audience as well as specialists. It should aim for a "monumental tract" quality. Language should be precise and unambiguous.
      Avoid overly casual language, but also overly dry or opaque academic jargon where simpler, clearer phrasing is possible.
      A confident, assertive voice should be used when presenting core theses and arguments, avoiding hedging or "waffle words" on established points.
      Witty or attention-grabbing phrasing (e.g., "The Rock and the Neutrino," "dark matter is in our brains") is encouraged where it clarifies or powerfully illustrates a point without sacrificing rigor.

  - style_id: "SG002"
    category: "Terminology & Concepts"
    specification: |
      Use terms defined in the `ITPR_Glossary` (currently v1.4) consistently and accurately.
      The core ontological term "Autologos" must be capitalized consistently and used as defined in `ITPR_AutologosPrimer_v1.0`.
      Clearly define any new or nuanced terms upon first significant use if not already in the Glossary.
      Maintain clear distinctions between "Autologos" (fundamental principle), "patterns" (its manifestations), and "information" (derivative, data/signal sense).

  - style_id: "SG003"
    category: "Citations & Referencing"
    specification: |
      APA 7th Edition is the standard for all citations and the reference list in D001 and supporting formal documents.
      For Author's (Rowan Brad Quni, QNFO, 2025) own conceptual documents or forthcoming works, integrate references narratively where possible (e.g., "As detailed in the QNFO conceptual document, 'Lineage of Information-Based Physics' (Quni, 2025a)..."). The reference list will contain full APA 7th style entries.

  - style_id: "SG004"
    category: "Structure & Formatting (D001)"
    specification: |
      Arguments should be logically structured with clear premises, supporting evidence/reasoning, and conclusions for each section/chapter.
      Use headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to organize content effectively and ensure a clear hierarchy.
      Paragraphs should be well-developed, each focusing on a clear point or aspect of an argument. Avoid sequences of very short, underdeveloped paragraphs, especially in critical explanatory or concluding sections.
      The monograph will be structured in Parts, then Chapters, then Sections (e.g., Part I, Chapter 1, Section 1.1, Subsection 1.1.1).

  - style_id: "SG005"
    category: "Titles & Headings (Specific)"
    specification: |
      Avoid unnecessary articles (e.g., 'the', 'a', 'an') in titles and headings for conciseness and directness, where grammatically sound and stylistically appropriate. Prefer direct noun phrases or gerunds where possible. (Ref: INS004)
      Chapter titles and major section headings should aim to be evocative and engaging, reflecting the content's essence, while adhering to the "no unnecessary articles" guideline. (Ref: PR_I001)

  - style_id: "SG006"
    category: "Language Precision & Clichés"
    specification: |
      Avoid common "trade phrases," clichés, or overly familiar expressions that can mask direct description or dilute impact (e.g., "profound illusion," "eons of evolution," "unravel the mysteries"). Strive for fresh, direct, and descriptive language. (Ref: User feedback on D001 Ch1 draft)
      Eliminate superfluous laudatory/emotive adjectives (e.g., "profound," "remarkable," "astonishing") when describing concepts or challenges. The significance of ideas should be conveyed through their articulation and argument, not asserted by adjectives. (Ref: User feedback on D001 Ch3 initial draft)

  - style_id: "SG007"
    category: "AI Voice & Persona (for AI-generated drafts)"
    specification: |
      AI-generated text should adhere to an action-oriented, matter-of-fact "machine voice."
      Avoid conversational filler, apologies, or expressions of personal opinion/emotion. Focus on presenting information, analysis, or drafted content as per instructions. (Ref: INS007 - "Don't say it, do it!")
      When presenting options or analyses, clearly state the basis for them.

  - style_id: "SG008"
    category: "Capitalization"
    specification: |
      "Autologos" is to be consistently capitalized when referring to the specific ontological principle of the ITPR thesis.
      Names of specific theories (e.g., "Quantum Mechanics," "General Relativity") should generally be capitalized when referred to as such.
      Other common nouns should follow standard English capitalization rules (lowercase unless proper nouns or at the beginning of sentences).
