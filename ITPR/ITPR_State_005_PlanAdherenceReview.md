Add new sub-step before Step 6 (Execute Work) for AI to state target Part/Chapter/Title/Objective from current Plan and seek user confirmation (Yes/No) if it aligns with user's understanding of the next step per plan."
      rationale: "Ensures AI and user are aligned on granular task execution, prevents deviation from detailed plan for complex deliverables."
