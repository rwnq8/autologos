project_summary: "This project aims to develop and articulate a philosophical thesis proposing that perception and reality are best understood through an information-theoretic lens. It argues that all forms of 'seeing,' from human vision to advanced scientific instruments, are fundamentally processes of pattern detection within a universe where physical reality itself is a manifestation of underlying information."
project_vision: "To establish a clear and compelling argument for an information-theoretic interpretation of perception and reality, contributing to philosophical discourse on epistemology and the nature of existence."
goals_objectives:
  - id: "G001"
    description: "Articulate a comprehensive thesis that perception and reality are best understood through an information-theoretic lens."
    metrics: "Thesis clearly formulated and documented."
  - id: "G002"
    description: "Demonstrate how various observation methods (e.g., eyes, optics, radio astronomy, quantum detection) support the 'pattern detection' model rather than direct perception of physical matter."
    metrics: "Analysis of at least three distinct observational methods completed and integrated into the argument."
  - id: "G003"
    description: "Posit that what we consider 'physical' is a manifestation of underlying information patterns, distinct from being primary physical substance."
    metrics: "Argument for the informational nature of the physical clearly presented and defended."
key_deliverables:
  - id: "D001"
    name: "Foundational Text on Information-Theoretic Perception"
    description: "A comprehensive essay, paper, or book chapter presenting the core thesis, arguments, and supporting analyses."
    acceptance_criteria: "Content is coherent, well-argued, aligns with project goals, and is suitable for its intended audience (e.g., academic, philosophical)."
  - id: "D002"
    name: "Structured Argument Set"
    description: "A concise set of theses and supporting points for discussion, potential presentation, or further development."
    acceptance_criteria: "Arguments are logically structured and clearly articulated."
scope_in:
  - "Philosophical articulation of the core thesis."
  - "Analysis of historical and modern observational methods as supporting evidence for pattern detection."
  - "Discussion of mathematics and statistics as tools for interpreting informational patterns."
  - "Relating the thesis to established philosophical concepts (e.g., epistemology) and relevant scientific paradigms (e.g., aspects of digital physics)."
scope_out:
  - "The design or construction of new scientific instruments or technologies."
  - "Providing definitive empirical proof or falsification of the thesis (focus is on philosophical articulation and argument)."
  - "Development of a complete, predictive mathematical formalism of a complete information-based cosmology (focus is conceptual)."
  - "In-depth exploration of practical applications in unrelated domains (e.g., AI, engineering, medicine), beyond illustrative examples."
  - "Resolving the 'hard problem' of subjective consciousness directly, beyond its relation to information processing aspects of perception."
assumptions:
  - "The primary output is a written philosophical work."
  - "Existing literature on information theory, philosophy of science, and perception is accessible."
  - "The author (Rowan Brad Quni) is the primary knowledge resource and decision-maker for content."
constraints:
  - "The project relies on conceptual analysis and argumentation, not empirical experimentation."
  - "Timeline for completion will be determined in the planning phase."
high_level_risks:
  - id: "R001"
    description: "Difficulty in articulating complex philosophical concepts clearly."
    mitigation: "Iterative writing, seeking feedback, use of analogies and examples."
  - id: "R002"
    description: "Potential for arguments to be misinterpreted as solipsistic or denying objective reality."
    mitigation: "Careful phrasing and explicit addressing of such potential misinterpretations."
  - id: "R003"
    description: "Scope creep into overly broad philosophical or scientific domains."
    mitigation: "Adherence to defined scope; regular review against charter."
