    overall_assessment: "Successful foundational reset and conceptual/methodological refinement."
    goals_achievement:
      - "G001 (Deconstruct conventional understandings - via Plan for Part I): Partially Met (Plan established)."
      - "G002 (Define Autologos): Met (Primer, Glossary, Plan for Part II)."
      - "G003 (Demonstrate Autologos explanatory power): Not Started (Planned for D001 Parts III)."
      - "G004 (Explore implications): Not Started (Planned for D001 Part IV)."
      - "G005 (Produce Monograph D001): Partially Met (Chapter 1 drafted, robust plan for full development)."
      - "G006 (Develop KAs): Met (All core KAs developed and active)."
      - "G007 (Refine process): Met (Extensive TIDs and protocol updates generated)."
    scope_variance_summary: "Project scope significantly evolved from initial ITPR to focus on 'Autologos' and a more rigorous, pedagogically sound monograph structure. This closure captures that evolved scope."
    quality_summary: "High quality foundational KAs and a robust Plan v1.3 produced. AI operational protocols significantly strengthened through iterative error correction."
  lessons_learned: # Substantive lessons from Message #101
    - lesson_id: "LL_SUB_001"
      category: "Ontological Foundation"
      lesson: "The term 'Information,' due to its prevalent Shannon-esque and data-centric connotations, proved insufficient and prone to misinterpretation as a primary ontological principle. A new, precisely defined term ('Autologos') was necessary to encapsulate the concept of a fundamental, self-generating, self-structuring, and rational principle of reality."
      implication_for_future_work: "The 'Autologos' concept, as defined in its Primer and Glossary, must be the consistent and unambiguous foundation for all subsequent theoretical development in the 'AUTO' project."
    - lesson_id: "LL_SUB_002" # ... (and LL_SUB_003 to LL_SUB_007 from Message #101)
    # Meta-process lessons are captured in PRV001 and TIDs.

    - "The 'AUTO' project should commence with `01-Initiate`, using this ITPR closure output (specifically `project_state.exploration_history` and supporting documents) as its primary exploration input."
    - "The full list of Template Improvement Directives (TID001-TID021) should be actioned by the 'ProcessMaintainer/AI' to update master project templates before widespread use in other new projects."
