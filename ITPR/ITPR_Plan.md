planning_assumptions:
  - "The 'Autologos' concept, as defined in ITPR_AutologosPrimer_v1.0 and ITPR_Glossary_v1.5, provides a stable and precise conceptual foundation for Monograph D001. 'Autologos' will be formally introduced to the reader only in Part II of the monograph."
  - "The 'Four Pillars' argumentative structure (Phenomena, Tools, Methods, Frameworks) is the mandated approach for the deconstructive phase (Part I) of D001. Part I will build the case for a new foundational principle *without* naming or alluding to 'Autologos'."
  - "Development of D001 will be iterative. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) reflects chapter-level granularity for Part I, with dedicated Knowledge Synthesis tasks for each chapter (Ch2-6) to ensure depth. Subsequent Parts are planned at a higher level initially, allowing for emergent structuring based on Part I's outcomes."
  - "The Author (Rowan Brad Quni) is the primary source of conceptual insights and provides all final approvals. The AI Project Assistant operates under direct Author guidance."
  - "The AI will adhere strictly to all agreed-upon operational protocols, including those for AI machine voice, data integrity, YAML output completeness, placeholder handling, and the 'AI self-critique with excerpts' review model, as defined in ITPR_CollabGuide_v1.2 and relevant Template Improvement Directives."
  - "The global Part I Knowledge Synthesis (output of T002.A.KS_Global / TEI_ITPR_Reset_001) serves as a foundational reference for all chapter-specific synthesis tasks in Part I."
  - "All AI-generated content for D001 will adhere to ITPR_StyleGuide_v1.2 (APA 7th, assertive tone, no clich√©s, no unnecessary articles in headings) and use terminology consistent with ITPR_Glossary_v1.5."
wbs_strategy_rationale: "A deliverable-based Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is implemented for Monograph D001. This WBS employs a phased, 'rolling wave' approach with explicit chapter-level granularity for Part I. Part I, 'The Grand Illusion - Deconstructing Perceived Reality' (comprising Chapters 1-6), focuses entirely on deconstruction using the Four Pillars methodology and illustrative spectra; it will not introduce or allude to 'Autologos'. Part II, 'Introducing Autologos - The Foundational Principle' (commencing with Chapter 7), will formally define and elaborate on 'Autologos'. Part III, 'Autologos at Work - Reinterpreting the Cosmos,' will apply the framework. Part IV, 'The Autologos Vista - Implications and Horizons,' will explore consequences and provide a concluding synthesis. Each chapter within Part I (Chapters 1-6) has distinct sub-tasks for Knowledge Synthesis (for Ch2-6, drawing from global Part I synthesis and chapter-specific author guidance), Outlining, Drafting, and Refining. This iterative and granular strategy is designed for foundational conceptual work where the detailed structure evolves, while ensuring strict adherence to the phased introduction of core concepts."

communication_plan_notes: "Primary communication via this interactive system. Iterative feedback loops for D001 chapters. Formal review/approval points at end of KA development, Plan finalization, D001 Chapter/Part completions, and final D001 draft. Decisions logged in `project_state.logs.decisions`. AI will use explicit pre-draft chapter confirmation protocol."
stakeholder_management_notes: "Primary stakeholder: Author (Rowan Brad Quni), with continuous engagement. AI Project Assistant: key internal. Potential Readers/Reviewers: secondary, external, considered in D001's style and clarity."
change_management_approach: "Iterative conceptual development is expected for D001. Minor changes managed flexibly. Significant changes to scope (Charter v2.0), core methodology, or major deliverables require explicit re-confirmation and potential Plan/Charter update. All key decisions logged. Plan v1.3's granular WBS provides better control for managing evolving content within chapters/parts."
methodology_specific_planning: |
  The "Conceptual Analysis, Argumentative Synthesis, and Iterative Monograph Development (AI-Assisted)" methodology is implemented via:
  - A phased WBS for D001 with chapter-level granularity (Knowledge Synthesis, Outline, Draft, Refine per chapter), allowing conceptual depth to build iteratively.
  - Strong reliance on foundational KAs (Primer, Glossary, Style Guide) to guide AI content generation.
  - The "Four Pillars" argumentative structure for D001 Part I (deconstruction phase).
  - Strict deferred introduction of "Autologos" to Part II to ensure pedagogical clarity.
  - The "AI self-critique with excerpts" review model for D001 drafts, preceded by AI's explicit chapter target confirmation.
  - Continuous logging of insights for meta-process improvement (Goal G007).
internal_review_summary: "Plan v1.3 created. WBS for D001 Part I (T002.A) significantly refined with chapter-level summary tasks (T002.A.C1 to T002.A.C6), each now including a dedicated Knowledge Synthesis sub-task (for Ch2-6) to ensure depth of thought. This provides granularity for AI's pre-draft confirmation protocol and enforces deferred Autologos introduction. Global Part I KS (T002.A.KS_Global) is foundational. Chapter 1 (T002.A.C1) development is considered complete based on prior work. Risk register populated from Charter v2.0. All sections reviewed for adherence to new AI operational/stylistic directives."
