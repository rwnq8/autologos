terms:
  - term_id: "GT001"
    term_name: "Autologos"
    definition: |
      The core ontological term within the ITPR thesis for the fundamental, self-generating, self-structuring, and self-articulating rational principle of reality. It is the inherent order that constitutes and describes itself through the dynamic unfolding of patterns, from which all discernible phenomena (e.g., information, matter, physical laws) emerge.
    etymology: "Greek 'auto-' (self) + 'logos' (reason, principle, word, order)."
    related_concepts: ["Ontological Primacy", "Self-Organization", "Pattern Generation", "Logos (Classical)", "Information (Derivative)", "Physical Laws (Emergent)"]
    usage_notes: |
      The foundational concept of the ITPR thesis. Consistently capitalized. See `ITPR_AutologosPrimer_v1.0` for full details.

  - term_id: "GT002"
    term_name: "Perception"
    definition: |
      The active process by which a system (e.g., biological organism, AI) registers, processes, and interprets patterns (manifestations of Autologos) to construct an internal model of its environment and/or state. This is distinguished from naive "direct seeing." Within the ITPR thesis, all perception is considered an act of pattern decoding and model construction.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern Detection", "Model Construction (Cognitive)", "Information Processing (Cognitive)", "Direct Observation (Critique of)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Emphasizes the constructive and interpretive nature of all observation.

  - term_id: "GT003"
    term_name: "Pattern"
    definition: |
      A discernible regularity, structure, configuration, or dynamic sequence that manifests from the dynamics of Autologos. Patterns are the primary way Autologos becomes knowable or interactive, forming the basis for what is registered as information. They can be static or dynamic, simple or complex, and exist at all scales.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Information (Derivative)", "Structure", "Order", "Regularity"]
    usage_notes: |
      Fundamental forms reality takes as expressions of Autologos. "Physical objects" are considered stable, complex macroscopic patterns.

  - term_id: "GT004"
    term_name: "Information (Derivative Sense)"
    definition: |
      Registered, processed, or communicated patterns; data; signals; or the reduction of uncertainty for an observing system. This "information" is a derivative aspect related to the detection, differentiation, and interpretation of patterns manifested by Autologos. It is distinct from Autologos itself, which is the fundamental, pattern-generating principle.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Shannon Information", "Data", "Signal"]
    usage_notes: |
      Typically lowercase "information" in ITPR documents to distinguish from Autologos. Refers to "map-level" content.

  - term_id: "GT005"
    term_name: "Physicality"
    definition: |
      An emergent property of specific classes of highly stable, complex, and consistently interacting patterns generated by Autologos. Physicality is characterized by properties such as persistence, resistance, regular interaction according to discernible laws, and inter-subjective detectability. It is not a fundamental substance.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Emergence", "Matter (Emergent)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Contrasts with material realism. Physicality is a derived characteristic of certain robust Autologos-based phenomena.

  - term_id: "GT006"
    term_name: "Physical Laws"
    definition: |
      The consistent rules or principles inherent in Autologos that govern the evolution, interaction, and transformation of its manifested patterns. Human-formulated "laws of physics" (e.g., General Relativity, principles of Quantum Mechanics) are attempts to discover and mathematically model these fundamental rules of Autologos.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern Dynamics", "Rules of Interaction", "Scientific Model"]
    usage_notes: |
      Intrinsic operational principles of Autologos. Specific named theories like "General Relativity" are capitalized.

  - term_id: "GT007"
    term_name: "Knowledge Void"
    definition: |
      A metaphorical concept for a gap, anomaly, or unexplained pattern within current understanding or scientific models. The ITPR thesis argues such voids are often mistakenly reified into positive ontological entities (e.g., hypothetical particles, "dark" substances) instead of being seen as limits of existing interpretive frameworks concerning Autologos.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern (Anomalous)", "Scientific Model (Limitations of)", "Epistemology"]
    usage_notes: |
      Highlights an epistemological error. "Dark matter is in our brains" is a related expression.

  - term_id: "GT008"
    term_name: "Direct Observation (Critique)"
    definition: |
      The intuitive notion that perception provides unmediated, faithful access to an independent material reality. The ITPR thesis critiques this as an illusion, arguing all observation is an active, indirect process of pattern detection and model construction based on interactions with Autologos manifestations.
    related_concepts: ["Perception", "Naive Realism", "Model Construction (Cognitive)", "Pattern Detection"]
    usage_notes: |
      Central to shifting from a matter-first to an Autologos-first paradigm.

  - term_id: "GT009"
    term_name: "Map vs. Territory Analogy"
    definition: |
      A core analogy distinguishing reality itself (the "Territory," fundamentally Autologos) from our perceptions, models, theories, and data about it (the "Map," consisting of registered/interpreted patterns or "information"). Progress involves refining the map, recognizing it is not the Territory, whose generative principle (Autologos) is distinct.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Perception", "Scientific Model", "Information (Derivative Sense)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Warns against conflating descriptions/experiences with reality's fundamental nature.

  - term_id: "GT010"
    term_name: "Quantum Mechanics"
    definition: |
      A physical theory of atomic/subatomic scales. The ITPR thesis reinterprets Quantum Mechanics not as a theory of material particles, but as describing probabilistic rules and interaction dynamics of specific Autologos-generated patterns. Its "weirdness" arises from applying classical object-ontology to Autologos-based phenomena.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Quantization", "Physical Laws"]
    usage_notes: |
      Capitalized when referring to the specific theory.

  - term_id: "GT011"
    term_name: "Quantization"
    definition: |
      The characteristic of Autologos manifestations where interactions or state transitions occur in discrete, discernible units or patterns. This implies that Autologos registers or changes state in distinguishable steps, not fundamental material "packets" (quanta).
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Photon (Reinterpretation)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Reinterprets common physics meaning away from discrete particles towards discrete states/patterns of Autologos.

  - term_id: "GT012"
    term_name: "Photon (Reinterpretation)"
    definition: |
      Not a fundamental material particle, but a label for a discernible, quantized interaction pattern or energy-state change within the electromagnetic field (itself an Autologos manifestation). Its masslessness supports its non-material, Autologos-based pattern nature.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Quantization", "Electromagnetic Field"]
    usage_notes: |
      Challenges the naive particle view.

  - term_id: "GT013"
    term_name: "Dark Matter (Reinterpretation)"
    definition: |
      Cosmological phenomenon inferred from gravitational effects. The ITPR thesis reinterprets "dark matter" not as unknown physical substance but as a "knowledge void" or misinterpretation of gravitational patterns, hypothesized to arise from large-scale Autologos structures or unmodeled aspects of its governing rules.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Knowledge Void", "Gravitation"]
    usage_notes: |
      Critiques standard particle-based explanations.

  - term_id: "GT014"
    term_name: "Particle Accelerator (Epistemological View)"
    definition: |
      Instruments whose output is viewed not as direct detection of material particles, but as complex data patterns from high-energy interactions of Autologos manifestations. "Particle discoveries" are statistical inferences from these patterns, often highlighting "knowledge voids."
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern Detection", "Knowledge Void", "Statistical Inference"]
    usage_notes: |
      Focuses on "discovery" as pattern interpretation.

  - term_id: "GT015"
    term_name: "Infomatics"
    definition: |
      A previous research framework in the ITPR lineage (see Quni, 2025a, "Lineage of Information-Based Physics") that attempted to operationalize an information-theoretic universe via π (pi) and φ (phi, golden ratio) governance of a continuous informational field. Empirically falsified, it provided lessons for the Autologos concept.
