      key_findings_summary: |
        Progress on D001 is good: scope defined, knowledge synthesized, detailed outline (v1.4) approved.
        Several important strategic and stylistic preferences/decisions were discussed and are now formalized:
        1. SEO and conceptual keyword strategy for D001 is a guiding principle.
        2. Filename conventions (no version numbers in filenames) adopted.
        3. Style Guide updated for article use in titles/headings and evocative chapter titles.
        4. Process insights on date handling, KA reusability, plain language acknowledged for future template improvement.
        5. Need for a 'TemplateFeedbackSchema' for structured template improvement feedback identified.

        User requested sequential numbering for state files.
        User requested no articles in titles/headings (addressed via Style Guide update PR_I001).
        User noted KA reusability as valuable.
        User requested plain language in AI outputs.
        User identified need for a structured 'TemplateFeedbackSchema'.
