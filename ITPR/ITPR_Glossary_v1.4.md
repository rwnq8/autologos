  - term_id: "GT001" # Autologos (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Autologos"
    definition: |
      (ITPR Thesis Core Ontological Term) The fundamental, self-generating, self-structuring, and self-articulating rational principle of reality. It is the inherent order that both constitutes and describes itself through the dynamic unfolding of patterns. All discernible phenomena, including 'information' (data/signals), 'matter,' 'energy,' 'space,' 'time,' and 'physical laws,' emerge from the Autologos.
    etymology: "Greek 'auto-' (self) + 'logos' (reason, principle, word, order)."
    related_concepts: ["Ontological Primacy", "Self-Organization", "Pattern Generation", "Logos (Classical)", "Information (Derivative)", "Physical Laws (Emergent)"]
    usage_notes: |
      The foundational concept of the ITPR thesis. Consistently capitalized. See `ITPR_AutologosPrimer_v1.0` for full details.

  - term_id: "GT002" # Perception (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Perception"
    definition: |
      The active process by which a system (e.g., biological organism, AI) registers, processes, and interprets patterns (manifestations of Autologos) to construct an internal model of its environment and/or state. This is distinguished from naive "direct seeing." Within the ITPR thesis, all perception is considered an act of pattern decoding and model construction.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern Detection", "Model Construction (Cognitive)", "Information Processing (Cognitive)", "Direct Observation (Critique of)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Emphasizes the constructive and interpretive nature of all observation.

  - term_id: "GT003" # Pattern (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Pattern"
    definition: |
      A discernible regularity, structure, configuration, or dynamic sequence that manifests from the dynamics of Autologos. Patterns are the primary way Autologos becomes knowable or interactive, forming the basis for what is registered as information. They can be static or dynamic, simple or complex, and exist at all scales.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Information (Derivative)", "Structure", "Order", "Regularity"]
    usage_notes: |
      Fundamental forms reality takes as expressions of Autologos. "Physical objects" are considered stable, complex macroscopic patterns.

  - term_id: "GT004" # Information (Derivative Sense) (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Information (Derivative Sense)"
    definition: |
      Registered, processed, or communicated patterns; data; signals; or the reduction of uncertainty for an observing system. This "information" is a derivative aspect related to the detection, differentiation, and interpretation of patterns manifested by Autologos. It is distinct from Autologos itself, which is the fundamental, pattern-generating principle.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Shannon Information", "Data", "Signal"]
    usage_notes: |
      Typically lowercase "information" in ITPR documents to distinguish from Autologos. Refers to "map-level" content.

  - term_id: "GT005" # Physicality (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Physicality"
    definition: |
      An emergent property of specific classes of highly stable, complex, and consistently interacting patterns generated by Autologos. Physicality is characterized by properties such as persistence, resistance, regular interaction according to discernible laws, and inter-subjective detectability. It is not a fundamental substance.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Emergence", "Matter (Emergent)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Contrasts with material realism. Physicality is a derived characteristic of certain robust Autologos-based phenomena.

  - term_id: "GT006" # Physical Laws (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Physical Laws"
    definition: |
      The consistent rules or principles inherent in Autologos that govern the evolution, interaction, and transformation of its manifested patterns. Human-formulated "laws of physics" (e.g., General Relativity, principles of Quantum Mechanics) are attempts to discover and mathematically model these fundamental rules of Autologos.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern Dynamics", "Rules of Interaction", "Scientific Model"]
    usage_notes: |
      Intrinsic operational principles of Autologos. Specific named theories like "General Relativity" are capitalized.

  - term_id: "GT007" # Knowledge Void (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Knowledge Void"
    definition: |
      A metaphorical concept for a gap, anomaly, or unexplained pattern within current understanding or scientific models. The ITPR thesis argues such voids are often mistakenly reified into positive ontological entities (e.g., hypothetical particles, "dark" substances) instead of being seen as limits of existing interpretive frameworks concerning Autologos.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern (Anomalous)", "Scientific Model (Limitations of)", "Epistemology"]
    usage_notes: |
      Highlights an epistemological error. "Dark matter is in our brains" is a related expression.

  - term_id: "GT008" # Direct Observation (Critique) (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Direct Observation (Critique)"
    definition: |
      The intuitive notion that perception provides unmediated, faithful access to an independent material reality. The ITPR thesis critiques this as an illusion, arguing all observation is an active, indirect process of pattern detection and model construction based on interactions with Autologos manifestations.
    related_concepts: ["Perception", "Naive Realism", "Model Construction (Cognitive)", "Pattern Detection"]
    usage_notes: |
      Central to shifting from a matter-first to an Autologos-first paradigm.

  - term_id: "GT009" # Map vs. Territory Analogy (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Map vs. Territory Analogy"
    definition: |
      A core analogy distinguishing reality itself (the "Territory," fundamentally Autologos) from our perceptions, models, theories, and data about it (the "Map," consisting of registered/interpreted patterns or "information"). Progress involves refining the map, recognizing it is not the Territory, whose generative principle (Autologos) is distinct.

    usage_notes: |
      Warns against conflating descriptions/experiences with reality's fundamental nature.

  - term_id: "GT010" # Quantum Mechanics (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Quantum Mechanics"
    definition: |
      A physical theory of atomic/subatomic scales. The ITPR thesis reinterprets Quantum Mechanics not as a theory of material particles, but as describing probabilistic rules and interaction dynamics of specific Autologos-generated patterns. Its "weirdness" arises from applying classical object-ontology to Autologos-based phenomena.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Quantization", "Physical Laws"]
    usage_notes: |
      Capitalized when referring to the specific theory.

    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Photon (Reinterpretation)"]
    usage_notes: |
      Reinterprets common physics meaning away from discrete particles towards discrete states/patterns of Autologos.

    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern", "Quantization", "Electromagnetic Field"]
    usage_notes: |
      Challenges the naive particle view.

  - term_id: "GT013" # Dark Matter (Reinterpretation) (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Dark Matter (Reinterpretation)"
    definition: |
      Cosmological phenomenon inferred from gravitational effects. The ITPR thesis reinterprets "dark matter" not as unknown physical substance but as a "knowledge void" or misinterpretation of gravitational patterns, hypothesized to arise from large-scale Autologos structures or unmodeled aspects of its governing rules.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Knowledge Void", "Gravitation"]
    usage_notes: |
      Critiques standard particle-based explanations.

    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Pattern Detection", "Knowledge Void", "Statistical Inference"]
    usage_notes: |
      Focuses on "discovery" as pattern interpretation.

  - term_id: "GT015" # Infomatics (as in v1.3)
    term_name: "Infomatics"
    definition: |
      A previous research framework in the ITPR lineage (see Quni, 2025a, "Lineage of Information-Based Physics") that attempted to operationalize an information-theoretic universe via π (pi) and φ (phi, golden ratio) governance of a continuous informational field. Empirically falsified, it provided lessons for the Autologos concept. The term also refers to a QNFO publication by Quni (2025) critiquing "quantum" and proposing "infomatics" as a new paradigm.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos (as successor concept)", "π (pi)", "φ (phi, golden ratio)", "Falsification", "Information Dynamics"]

    usage_notes: |
      A contrasting ontological viewpoint.

  - term_id: "GT046"
    term_name: "Physicalism"
    definition: |
      The ontological thesis that everything is physical, or that there is nothing over and above the physical. Often used interchangeably with materialism, though some distinctions exist. ITPR challenges physicalism by proposing Autologos as more fundamental than the "physical" (which is seen as an emergent pattern-complex of Autologos).
    related_concepts: ["Materialism", "Autologos", "Physicality", "Ontology"]
    usage_notes: |
      A dominant contemporary ontological view that ITPR seeks to revise.

  - term_id: "GT047"
    term_name: "Idealism"
    definition: |
      A group of metaphysical philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. While ITPR posits a non-material basis (Autologos), it aims to distinguish itself from subjective or radical idealism by asserting the objective nature of Autologos and its rules.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Ontology", "Materialism (Contrast with)", "Solipsism (Distinction from)"]
    usage_notes: |
      ITPR defines Autologos as objective, not mind-dependent in a Berkeleyan sense.

    term_name: "Realism (Philosophical)"
    definition: |
      In philosophy, the viewpoint which accords to things which are known or perceived an existence or nature which is independent of whether anyone is thinking about or perceiving them. The ITPR thesis proposes a form of "Informational Realism" or "Autologos Realism," where Autologos and its generative rules are objectively real, independent of human minds, though our perception of its manifestations is constructive.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Naive Realism (Critique of)", "Objectivity", "Idealism (Contrast with)"]
    usage_notes: |
      ITPR is a form of realism, but not naive material realism.

    term_name: "π (pi)"
    definition: |
      A fundamental mathematical constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (approximately 3.14159). In the (falsified) Infomatics framework, π was hypothesized as a governing geometric principle of a continuous informational field, related to cycles and phases. Its role in an Autologos framework is as a descriptor of certain pattern geometries.
    related_concepts: ["Infomatics", "Mathematics", "Pattern", "Geometry"]

In the (falsified) Infomatics framework, φ was hypothesized as a governing geometric principle related to scaling and stability. Its role in an Autologos framework is as a descriptor of certain pattern properties or dynamics.

    usage_notes: |
      A mathematical tool/descriptor, not an ontological primitive in the Autologos framework.

  - term_id: "GT051"
    term_name: "Bit"
    definition: |
      A basic unit of information in computing and digital communications, typically representing a logical state with one of two possible values (0 or 1). In Shannon Information Theory, it quantifies the reduction of uncertainty by half. Wheeler's "It from Bit" used "bit" more broadly for a fundamental distinction.

    usage_notes: |
      Represents discrete states within the derivative sense of information, not fundamental to Autologos itself.

  - term_id: "GT052"
    term_name: "Entropy (Information Theory)"
    definition: |
      A measure of the uncertainty, randomness, or average information content associated with a random variable or a message source, as defined by Claude Shannon. Higher entropy implies less predictability.
    related_concepts: ["Information (Derivative Sense)", "Shannon Information", "Probability", "Order (Contrast with)"]
    usage_notes: |
      A statistical property of ensembles of patterns/messages, distinct from Autologos.

  - term_id: "GT053"
    term_name: "Complexity Theory"
    definition: |
      An interdisciplinary field studying systems with many interacting components whose aggregate behavior is non-trivial to predict from the components alone (e.g., emergence, self-organization, chaos). Autologos is conceived as a source of such complexity.
    related_concepts: ["Emergence", "Self-Organization", "Pattern", "System"]
    usage_notes: |
      Provides tools and concepts for understanding manifestations of Autologos.

  - term_id: "GT054"
    term_name: "System"
    definition: |
      A set of interacting or interdependent components forming an integrated whole, characterized by its structure, purpose, and behavior within an environment. Reality as Autologos can be conceived as a vast, self-generating system, and perceiving beings are complex sub-systems within it.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Self-Organization", "Pattern", "Information Processing (Cognitive)"]
    usage_notes: |
      A useful concept for describing organized manifestations of Autologos.

  - term_id: "GT055"
    term_name: "Reason"
    definition: |
      The capacity for consciously making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. In ITPR, human reason is a tool for apprehending the rational nature of Autologos.
    related_concepts: ["Autologos", "Logic", "Epistemology", "Scientific Model"]
    usage_notes: |
      "Rationality" is an inherent aspect of Autologos; human "reason" is our faculty for engaging with it.
