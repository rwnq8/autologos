# ITPR_SuccessMetrics_v1.0
# Project: ITPR - A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autologos
# Version: 1.0

metrics:
  - metric_id: "SM001"
    category: "Conceptual Framework Development (Autologos)"
    description: "Clarity, coherence, and robustness of the 'Autologos' concept as defined and elaborated in KA001 (Autologos Primer), KA002 (Glossary), and throughout Monograph D001."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - "Autologos" is clearly defined and consistently applied.
      - Its characteristics and implications are logically developed.
      - It is effectively distinguished from prior concepts (e.g., Shannon information, classical Logos).
      - It serves as a viable ontological foundation for the ITPR thesis.
    assessment_method: "Author review and approval of KA001, KA002, and relevant sections of D001. Internal AI consistency checks against definitions."
    related_goals: ["G002"]

  - metric_id: "SM002"
    category: "Argumentation & Critique (D001 - Part I)"
    description: "Effectiveness and persuasiveness of the deconstruction of conventional understandings of perception, 'direct observation,' and 'physical matter' in the initial part(s) of D001, utilizing the 'Four Pillars' structure and illustrative spectra."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - The critique of naive realism and materialism is compelling and well-supported by examples.
      - The 'Four Pillars' (Phenomena, Tools, Methods, Frameworks) are used effectively to structure the deconstruction.
      - The argument successfully establishes the intellectual necessity for a new foundational principle (Autologos).
    assessment_method: "Author review and approval of relevant D001 sections. Logical analysis of argument structure."
    related_goals: ["G001"]

  - metric_id: "SM003"
    category: "Explanatory Power (D001 - Autologos Application)"
    description: "Demonstrated explanatory power of the Autologos framework in reinterpreting key phenomena and concepts from physics (quantum mechanics, cosmology) and perception science within D001."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - Autologos-based reinterpretations of selected phenomena (e.g., 'particles,' 'quantization,' 'gravity,' 'dark matter/energy') are coherent, insightful, and consistent with the Autologos definition.
      - The framework shows potential to resolve or reframe existing paradoxes or "knowledge voids."
    assessment_method: "Author review and approval of relevant D001 sections."
    related_goals: ["G003"]

  - metric_id: "SM004"
    category: "Philosophical Implications (D001)"
    description: "Depth and clarity of the exploration of epistemological and ontological implications of an Autologos-centric worldview in D001."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - Implications for knowledge, truth, scientific models, mathematics, and logic (as human tools) are thoughtfully addressed.
      - The discussion is philosophically sound and contributes to understanding the broader impact of the Autologos thesis.
    assessment_method: "Author review and approval of relevant D001 sections."
    related_goals: ["G004"]

  - metric_id: "SM005"
    category: "Primary Deliverable Completion (D001 - Monograph)"
    description: "Completion of the Monograph D001 ('A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autologos') to a standard aligning with the 'monumental tract' vision."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - Monograph is feature-complete as per the approved outline (or its evolved final structure).
      - Content is philosophically rigorous, conceptually coherent, clearly articulated, and stylistically engaging.
      - Target word count (e.g., 20,000-30,000+ words, or as determined by content needs) is achieved.
      - Final draft receives full approval from the Author (Rowan Brad Quni).
    assessment_method: "Author review, iterative feedback cycles, and final sign-off on D001."
    related_goals: ["G005"]

  - metric_id: "SM006"
    category: "Knowledge Artifact Quality & Utility"
    description: "Core Knowledge Artifacts (Autologos Primer, Glossary, Style Guide, Collab Guide, Success Metrics) are developed, maintained, and effectively support project execution and D001 quality."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - All core KAs are created and achieve 'Active' status with Author approval.
      - KAs are consistently used and referenced during D001 development.
      - KAs are updated as needed to reflect project evolution and maintain conceptual consistency.
    assessment_method: "Author review and approval of each KA. Evidence of KA use in project logs and D001 development."
    related_goals: ["G006"]

  - metric_id: "SM007"
    category: "Process Improvement (Meta-Goal)"
    description: "Continuous refinement of the AI-assisted project management and content generation methodology through logged insights and actionable proposals."
    target_value_or_condition: |
      - Significant process improvement insights (target >= 5, as per previous metric example, or qualitatively assessed) are identified, logged (INS objects), and analyzed.
      - Actionable proposals for template/methodology updates are documented (e.g., in PRV001 or as TemplateImprovementDirective instances).
      - Evidence of AI adapting to new directives and improving its operational efficiency/quality.
    assessment_method: "Review of `project_state.logs.insights`, `project_state.monitoring_control.process_reviews`, and `project_state.metadata.template_improvement_directives` at project milestones and closure. Author assessment of AI adaptability."
