# D001 (Foundational Text) Scope Definition - Output of T002.0

**Project:** ITPR - Information-Theoretic Perception and Reality
**Task:** T002.0 - Define Scope & Format for Foundational Text (D001)
**Date Finalized (Conceptual):** [AI_DATE_GENERATION_PROHIBITED]

## 1. Format:
Extended Monograph / Short Book (or a very substantial, multi-part academic paper).
This format allows for the necessary depth to explore the complex thesis and can be structured with distinct sections/chapters that build the argument progressively.

## 2. Target Length:
15,000 - 25,000 words.
This range is substantial enough for a deep treatment of the subject matter and can be broken down for serialization or adapted for different publication venues if desired later.

## 3. Tone & Style:
Academic and analytical, maintaining rigor while ensuring clarity for a broad intellectual audience interested in philosophy, science, and the nature of reality.
Citation Style: APA 7th Edition.

## 4. High-Level Structure Concept (Initial - To be refined in T002.2 Outline):
1.  **Introduction:** The Problem of "Seeing" and the Information-Theoretic Proposition.
2.  **The Limits of Direct Perception:** From Human Vision to Instrumental Observation as Pattern Detection.
3.  **Information as the Fabric:** Reinterpreting Physicality and Quantum Observations.
4.  **Mathematics & Statistics:** The Language of Patterns in an Informational Universe.
5.  **Philosophical Implications:** Epistemology, Ontology, and the Nature of Reality.
6.  **Addressing Misinterpretations & Future Directions:** Including discussion of potential misinterpretations (e.g., solipsism) and outlining avenues for future research or development of the thesis.
7.  **Conclusion:** Synthesizing the Information-Theoretic View and its significance.

## 5. Strategic Considerations (Informing Content Development):
*   **Conceptual SEO:** The text should strategically incorporate relevant existing keywords and aim to establish new, unique conceptual phrases associated with the author's thesis to enhance discoverability and thought leadership (Ref: INS003).
*   **QNFO Branding:** The term "QNFO" should be used thoughtfully where appropriate to build association with the author's unique approach.

**Approval:** This scope definition is considered approved by the Author (Rowan Brad Quni) to guide subsequent development of D001.
