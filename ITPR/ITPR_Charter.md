# project_state.charter content:
version: "2.0" # New version for this reset project
status: "Formalized"
project_summary: "This project aims to develop and articulate a new ontological framework centered on 'Autologos' – a fundamental, self-generating, self-structuring, and self-articulating rational principle of reality. It will demonstrate how this framework provides coherent explanations for perception (as active pattern detection), 'physicality' (as emergent from Autologos-generated patterns), and phenomena in quantum mechanics and cosmology, thereby critiquing and offering an alternative to prevailing materialist/physicalist ontologies and naive realism. The primary deliverable is a monograph tentatively titled 'A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autologos.'"
project_vision: "To establish 'Autologos' as a compelling and transformative foundational principle for understanding reality, perception, and science, significantly contributing to philosophical and scientific discourse, and positioning the primary written work as a 'monumental tract' that redefines our engagement with the universe."

scope_in:
  - "Development of the Autologos concept as a fundamental ontological principle."
  - "Philosophical argumentation and conceptual analysis."
  - "Critique of materialism, physicalism, and naive realism regarding perception and reality."
  - "Reinterpretation of established scientific concepts and observations from physics (quantum mechanics, cosmology, particle physics) and perception science through the Autologos framework."
  - "Application of the 'Four Pillars' (Phenomena, Tools, Methods, Frameworks) as a deconstructive and illustrative methodology in the initial part(s) of D001."

  - "Production of the monograph D001 and supporting KAs (Primer, Glossary, Style Guide, Collab Guide, Success Metrics)."
  - "Iterative refinement of project management templates and AI operational protocols based on project experience, including generation of Template Improvement Directives."
scope_out:
  - "Development of new, predictive mathematical formalisms or equations for Autologos dynamics (focus is conceptual and philosophical at this stage)."
  - "Providing definitive empirical proof or experimental falsification of the Autologos thesis (focus is on conceptual coherence, explanatory power, and reinterpretation of existing knowledge at this stage)."
  - "Detailed engagement with specific historical theological interpretations of 'Logos' beyond brief etymological/contextual notes relevant to 'Autologos'."
  - "Attempting to definitively solve the 'Hard Problem' of subjective consciousness (though its relation to an Autologos framework may be discussed)."
  - "Design or proposal of new scientific experiments."
  - "Application of the Autologos framework to unrelated domains beyond philosophy and foundational science (e.g., detailed social or political theory)."
assumptions:
  - "The Author (Rowan Brad Quni) is the primary source of core conceptual insights and makes all final decisions on content and project direction."
  - "The AI Project Assistant provides support in research, drafting, analysis, refinement, and project process management, operating under the Author's guidance and defined AISkills."
  - "The project will proceed through iterative cycles of drafting, review, and refinement, including potential restructuring of D001 as conceptual clarity evolves."
  - "Existing scientific knowledge and philosophical literature are accessible resources for reinterpretation."
  - "The concept of 'Autologos' is sufficiently robust to serve as a new ontological foundation and will be clearly defined in KA001 and KA002."
  - "The 'Four Pillars' argumentative structure provides a sound basis for the initial deconstructive phase of D001."
constraints:
  - "The project relies primarily on conceptual analysis, logical argumentation, and reinterpretation of existing knowledge, not new empirical data generation."
  - "The primary output (D001) is a written philosophical/scientific monograph, the exact length and chapter structure of which may evolve."
  - "Timeline for completion is TBD in planning but prioritizes conceptual depth and clarity."
  - "AI capabilities are as defined in the AISkillsCatalog (v1.5) and current operational protocols; AI cannot generate novel scientific discoveries or unprompted philosophical breakthroughs beyond synthesizing and developing user-provided concepts."
high_level_risks:
  - id: "R001"
    description: "Conceptual Complexity of Autologos: The 'Autologos' concept may prove too abstract, difficult to define with sufficient precision, or challenging for readers to grasp, potentially leading to misinterpretation or perceived lack of rigor."
    mitigation: "Develop a clear Autologos Primer (KA001) and Glossary (KA002). Use extensive illustrative examples in D001. Iterative refinement of definitions and explanations based on Author feedback. Dedicate a substantial chapter in D001 to its introduction."
  - id: "R002"
    description: "Resistance to Paradigm Challenge: The thesis fundamentally challenges established paradigms (materialism, physicalism); may face strong skepticism or dismissal from adherents of current views."
    mitigation: "Ensure arguments are philosophically rigorous, well-supported by reinterpretation of accepted scientific observations, and address potential counter-arguments proactively. Focus on explanatory power, coherence, and addressing known paradoxes."
  - id: "R003"
    description: "Scope Creep / Evolving Structure: The ambitious nature of the project and the depth of conceptual exploration may lead to unmanageable scope creep or frequent significant restructuring of D001."
    mitigation: "Strict adherence to the defined 'Scope In' and 'Scope Out'. Regular review of D001 development against the Charter and Plan. Prioritize core arguments. Acknowledge iterative nature of D001 structure in planning."
  - id: "R004" # Retained from previous, still relevant
    description: "Terminological Instability: Despite SP002, the core ontological term ('Autologos') or other key terminology might require further refinement during D001 drafting, causing rework."
    mitigation: "The Autologos Primer and Glossary are intended to stabilize this. Any further changes must be carefully managed and globally implemented."
  - id: "R005" # Retained from previous, still relevant
    description: "AI Misalignment or Process Failure: AI may misinterpret complex instructions, fail to adhere to stylistic guidelines consistently, or encounter process errors (e.g., output truncation), requiring extensive author correction or process resets."
    mitigation: "Iterative review of AI-generated content in manageable chunks. Clear, specific prompting. Continuous refinement of AI operational protocols, KAs (CollabGuide, StyleGuide), and process templates based on logged insights (Goal G007)."
