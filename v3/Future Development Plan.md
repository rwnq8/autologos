**Improvement & Evolution Pipeline (Future Development Plan)**

This outlines how to continue improving AIOS `E_v3_3_2_M1` and troubleshoot.

**A. Current Functional Baseline:**

*   **Minified Script:** `E_v3_3_2_M1.py` (as per Artifact 1).
*   **Implemented MHs:**
    *   `IFE_M`: Functional (Idea -> Essence).
    *   `PDF_M`: Functional (Details -> Problem Decomposition).
    *   `PLAN_M`: Functional (Problem Def -> Phases & Tasks Plan).
    *   `TDE_M_STUB`: Iterates through the plan from `PLAN_M`, simulates task execution.
    *   `FEL_M`: Fully functional for engine self-evolution (as tested previously).
*   **Kernel:** Manages state, MH dispatch, and transitions: `IFE -> PDF -> PLAN -> TDE_STUB -> AUI_M`.

**B. Next Development Priorities (Replacing Stubs):**

The most impactful next step is to make `TDE_M` (Task Dispatch & Execution) functional.

1.  **`TID_TDE_FUNCTIONAL_V1`**: Implement a functional `TDE_M`.
    *   **Objective:** Replace `tde_s1_stub`. The new `TDE_M` will:
        *   Load the `plan_obj` from `CCOd`.
        *   Iterate through phases and tasks.
        *   For each task, look at its `mh_suggestion`.
        *   **Dispatch to other MHs:**
            *   If `mh_suggestion` is "CAG_M" (or similar), `TDE_M` will set `Kernel_CurrentMH_ID = "CAG_M_STUB"` (or a future functional `CAG_M`), prepare `Kernel_MH_Inputs_JsonString` (e.g., with the task details and current CCO), and then return control to the Kernel (`k_pmhr`) which will call `k_rcmh` to run CAG.
            *   A mechanism will be needed for the sub-MH (CAG) to return its result *back* to `TDE_M` so TDE can mark the task complete and move to the next one. This often involves the sub-MH returning a specific status that `k_pmhr` recognizes, which then calls a `TDE_M` continuation method (e.g., `tde_s2_process_sub_mh_result`).
        *   **Handle direct LLM tasks:** If `mh_suggestion` is "N/A_LLM_TASK" or similar, `TDE_M` would formulate a `clr` request for the LLM to perform that specific task directly.
        *   **Log task execution:** Update `CCOd` with the status/results of each task.
    *   **State:** `self.s_tde` will need to track current phase, current task, and results.
    *   **Impact:** This will make the engine truly execute a plan.

2.  **`TID_CAG_FUNCTIONAL_V1`**: Implement a functional `CAG_M` (Content Auto-Generation).
    *   **Objective:** Replace current stubs. `CAG_M` would take a task from `TDE_M` (e.g., "Draft section X about topic Y based on CCO context Z") and use LLM requests to generate that content, potentially using MRO for refinement internally.
    *   **Impact:** Enables automated content generation based on the plan.

3.  **Implement other MH Stubs as Functional Units:** `KAU_M_STUB`, `SEL_M_STUB`, etc., based on project needs.

**C. Using FEL-MH for Self-Improvement:**

Once a few core MHs are functional, we can use `FEL_MH` to improve `E_v3_3_2_M1.py` itself.

1.  **Identify Improvement Area:** E.g., "The logging in `LToCH` is too verbose" or "The way `PLAN_M` iterates phases could be more efficient."
2.  **Formulate a TID:**
    *   `tid_id`: E.g., "TID_MINIFY_LOGTOCH_V1"
    *   `description`: "Reduce log output from LToCH by..."
    *   `evolution_type`: "Code_Refactoring" or "Performance_Optimization"
    *   `target_components`: ["E_v3_3_2_M1.LToCH"]
    *   `detailed_instructions`: Specific changes to make.
    *   `acceptance_criteria`: "Log output is less verbose but still informative. Functionality is preserved."
3.  **Run FEL-MH Cycle:**
    *   Start `E_v3_3_2_M1`.
    *   Choose "Evolve Engine".
    *   Provide the TID JSON when `fel_s1` asks.
    *   Simulate LLM responses for `fel_s2` (confirm TID load), `fel_s3` (provide next version string, e.g., "3.3.2.M2"), `fel_s4` (conceptual model application), `fel_s5` (provide the *actual new script text* for `E_v3_3_2_M2.py` and a changelog).
4.  **Test the New Version:** The `GenEngArtefact_M` PUM will output the new script. Save it. Start a new AI Studio session (or clear context) and test this new script with the process in this README.

**D. Troubleshooting & "If It Breaks":**

If a previously working feature in `E_v3_3_2_M1` (or a future evolved version `E_vX.Y.Z.M_n`) stops working after an FEL-MH cycle or a manual modification:

1.  **Isolate the Change:**
    *   If it broke after an FEL-MH cycle, the primary suspect is the new script generated in `fel_s6`. Compare it to the previous version. The `changelog` provided in `fel_s6` should guide this.
    *   If it broke after a manual edit by you/me, that edit is the suspect.
2.  **Reproduce the Error with Minimal Steps:** Try to find the simplest sequence of inputs that triggers the bug in the new script.
3.  **Examine Logs:** The `engine.lh` (log history) is your best friend. Look at the logs from the failing run.
    *   What was the `KCM` (current MH)?
    *   What was the last successful operation?
    *   Are there any `ERR_..._M` messages from the engine?
4.  **Examine State:**
    *   What is the content of `engine.CCOd`?
    *   What is the content of the relevant `engine.s_...` dictionary for the failing MH?
5.  **Formulate a "Bug Fix" TID (if applicable for FEL-MH):**
    *   If the bug was introduced by an incorrect evolution, a new TID could be "TID_BUGFIX_XYZ_V1: Correct the logic in method ABC that was broken by TID_PREVIOUS_DEFECTIVE_ONE."
    *   Run this through FEL-MH.
6.  **Manual Debugging (More Likely for Complex Issues):**
    *   Provide me with:
        *   The exact script text of the failing version (`E_vX.Y.Z.M_n.py`).
        *   The JSON state string *just before* the failing step.
        *   The exact LLM response/user input that triggered the failure.
        *   The full `tool_code` output including all logs and error messages.
    *   I will then analyze this to pinpoint the Python error or logical flaw. We can then collaboratively fix the script text.

**Key Principle for Stability:** Before committing to a new evolved script from FEL-MH as the "official" baseline, it should be tested with a standard suite of operations (e.g., run IFE->PDF->PLAN->TDE_STUB successfully).
