Changelog for AIOS Engine v3.3.1-evolved:

1.  **Framework Evolution (FEL-MH Cycle Completion):**
    *   This version is the result of a simulated Framework Evolution Loop.

2.  **Method Deduplication (TID_FEL_DEDUP_METHODS_V1):**
    *   The entire class script has been reviewed for duplicate method definitions.
    *   All redundant (earlier) definitions of methods have been removed. The last definition of each method in the original script (v3.3.0) has been retained, ensuring functional continuity as per Python's standard behavior. This significantly cleans up the codebase.

3.  **Enhanced Startup Logging (TID_FEL_STARTUP_LOGGING_OPT_V1):**
    *   Added detailed, timestamped logging to the `__init__` method:
        *   Log message at the very start of `__init__` execution.
        *   Log message at the completion of `__init__` execution.
    *   Added detailed, timestamped logging to the `start_engine` method:
        *   Log message upon invocation of `start_engine`.
        *   Log message just before presenting the "Initializing" status to the user.
        *   Log message just before presenting the initial options to the user.
        *   Log message upon completion of `start_engine` (after the LLM request for initial options is generated).
    *   These logs will help in diagnosing any perceived startup delays and provide better visibility into the initialization sequence.

4.  **Version Update:**
    *   Class name updated to `AIOS_Engine_v3_3_1_evolved`.
    *   Internal version strings `self.engine_version_full` and `self.engine_version_short` updated to reflect "3.3.1-evolved".

5.  **Conceptual Review for Optimization (TID_FEL_STARTUP_LOGGING_OPT_V1):**
    *   The startup sequence (`__init__` and `start_engine`) was conceptually reviewed. No obvious, major synchronous bottlenecks were identified that could be trivially refactored without altering core logic in this pass. The primary overhead remains script parsing and initial object setup, which is inherent to the script's size. The new logging will help quantify this.
