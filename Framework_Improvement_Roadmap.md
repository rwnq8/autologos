# USAGE
instructions_for_ai: |
  This document is a living backlog of potential improvements for the MetaProcessEngineASO framework.
  It should be reviewed periodically. Items can be formalized into TIDs (if not already) and processed
  via FEL-MH (v2.8 Full Regeneration Model). The AI can parse this YAML to assist in managing and
  prioritizing these items. All definitions herein are explicit for this version.
