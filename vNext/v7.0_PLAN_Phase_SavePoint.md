AIOS Engine Code Snapshot (v7.0_PLAN_Phase_SavePoint)

This snapshot includes:
- Kernel class
- BaseMH class
- IFE_MH (Idea Formalization Engine Meta-Handler)
- PDF_MH (Project Definition Finalization Meta-Handler)
- PLAN_MH (Planning Meta-Handler)

The code is configured with default settings:
- Logging Verbosity: DEBUG
- Default CCO Schema Version: 4.0.0-demo-plan
- Engine Version: AIOS_Engine_v7.0_PLAN_Phase_SavePoint

This code represents the developmental state after implementing the PLAN-MH 
and allows for a simulated project lifecycle from idea formalization through 
project definition to high-level planning.

To use:
1. Ensure Python environment has `json`, `datetime`, `uuid`.
2. This script can be run directly to see the IFE->PDF->PLAN demonstration.
3. For operational use in a tool_code environment, this entire script would
   be prepended to the tool_code block that instantiates and operates the Kernel.

Next Steps in Development:
- TDE_MH (Task Decomposition & Execution)
- Sub-MHs for TDE (e.g., CAG_MH for artifact generation)
- MRO_MH (Meta-Refine Output) integration
- More robust error handling and user feedback loops.
