**Date and Time of Termination:** 2025-05-25T11:00:00Z
**Reason for Termination:** User-directed termination to allow for focused review and potential input on the v5.2 implementation plan before proceeding with development.

**AIOS Engine Version:** v5.1mfc-logopt (Current)
**Project:** AIOEv (AIOS Engine Evolution)

**Last Completed Logical Step:**  Generation of the refined implementation plan for AIOS Engine v5.2, addressing critical failures (CCO content capture, placeholders) and incorporating prioritized TIDs, LHLs, and roadmap items.

**Next Task to Resume Upon Session Restart:**  Review and provide feedback on the v5.2 implementation plan, particularly addressing the open questions regarding modularity, error handling, user manual, and benchmark suite.  Following this, the AI will proceed with the detailed implementation of v5.2.

**List of Files in this Termination Package:**

1.  `AIOS_Engine_Evolution_Report_v5.1_to_v5.2_Planning.md`:  A comprehensive report detailing the AIOEv process, root cause analysis, prioritized TIDs/LHLs, refined v5.2 implementation plan, open questions, and lessons learned.
2.  `AIOS_Engine_Evolution_Termination_Summary_20250525_110000Z.md` (This document)
3.  `AIOS_Engine_v5.1.py`:  (Not included - No modifications were made to the original script provided by the user at the start of the session).

**Instructions for Resumption in a New Chat Thread:**

1.  Provide the AI with the `AIOS_Engine_Evolution_Report_v5.1_to_v5.2_Planning.md` document to re-establish context.
2.  Review the report and provide feedback on the v5.2 implementation plan, particularly addressing the open questions.
3.  Instruct the AI to proceed with the implementation of AIOS Engine v5.2 based on the refined plan and your feedback.
