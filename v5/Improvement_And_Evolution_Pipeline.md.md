# Improvement & Evolution Pipeline (Future Development Plan)

This outlines how to continue improving AIOS (conceptually `E_v3_3_2_M1` or its successors) and troubleshoot.

**A. Current Functional Baseline (Conceptual `v5.0mfc-conv1` based on MVME simulation):**
*   **Minified Shell Execution:** `A_MVME_v3_4.py` provides fast load times.
*   **Orchestrator Simulates Full Logic:** The LLM orchestrator simulates the behavior of a conceptually minified and feature-rich AIOS (`v5.0mfc-conv1`), which includes:
    *   Functional IFE_M, PDF_M, PLAN_M.
    *   Functional TDE_M with sub-MH dispatch.
    *   Functional CAG_M.
    *   Functional SEL_M.
    *   Functional KAU_M.
    *   Functional FEL_M with stubs for self-TID generation and self-code modification.
    *   Advanced MRO_M.
    *   Validated Kernel logic.
    *   Conceptual modular design and robust error handling.

**B. Next Development Priorities (Making Conceptual Implementations Real):**

The most impactful next step is to translate the *conceptual* implementations of the TIDs that led to `v5.0mfc-conv1` into actual, runnable, minified Python code within a single, coherent engine script. This is the primary challenge.

1.  **`TID_GENERATE_RUNNABLE_V5_0_MFC_CONV1`**: Generate the actual Python script.
    *   **Objective:** The LLM Orchestrator's highest priority is to generate the complete, minified, syntactically correct Python script for `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc-conv1.py` (class `A_MFC_v5` or similar). This script must embody all the functionalities described for this converged version.
    *   **Process:** This will be an intensive generation task for the LLM, requiring it to synthesize all previous minification rules, MH logic, Kernel logic, and autonomy stubs into one file.
    *   **Validation:** Once generated, this script must be tested by loading it directly (not via MVME) and running a comprehensive test suite (e.g., a full IFE->PDF->PLAN->TDE->(Sub-MH like CAG)->KAU sequence).

2.  **If Direct Generation of `v5.0mfc-conv1` Fails Syntactically:**
    *   **Fallback to Incremental Generation:** Revert to the LLM generating minified code for *one MH or Kernel section at a time* from the verbose `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` as a base.
    *   **User Assembles & Validates:** The user would assemble these smaller, LLM-generated minified chunks into the full `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc-conv1.py`. Each chunk should be small enough for the LLM to generate with high syntactic accuracy.

3.  **Flesh out Autonomous Stubs in `v5.0mfc-conv1` (or its successor):**
    *   **`TID_IMPL_SELF_TID_GEN_FULL_V1`**: Expand the `fel_generate_self_improvement_tid` stub. This involves complex LLM prompting: the function needs to take a goal, analyze the (conceptual) current engine's codebase/documentation/requirements, and formulate valid TIDs.
    *   **`TID_IMPL_SELF_CODE_MOD_FULL_V1`**: Expand `fel_apply_script_to_self_conceptual`. This is the hardest part, involving the engine modifying its own running code or preparing a new version for a restart. For simulation, this might mean the engine outputs a `diff` or a complete new script text that the orchestrator then "applies" in the next session.

**C. Using FEL-MH for Further Self-Improvement (Once `v5.0mfc-conv1` is runnable):**

1.  **Initiate FEL-MH on `v5.0mfc-conv1`:**
    *   Task it with a high-level goal, e.g., "Improve efficiency of MRO cognitive tasks" or "Implement full modularization based on `TID_MODULARIZE_FULL_V1`."
2.  **AIOS Uses `fel_generate_self_improvement_tid`:** The engine should now use its (newly less stubbed) capability to generate a specific TID.
3.  **AIOS Executes FEL-MH Cycle:** It processes this self-generated TID, conceptually modifying itself to produce `v5.1mfc`, etc.

**D. Troubleshooting & "If It Breaks":** (Remains relevant)
As per the original `Future Development Plan.md`.

**Key Principle for Stability:** Any newly generated full engine script (like the target `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc-conv1.py`) must pass basic load and start tests, and then a suite of functional tests before being considered a stable baseline.
