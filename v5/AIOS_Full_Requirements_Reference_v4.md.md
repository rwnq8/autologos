# AIOS Full Requirements Document v4.0 (Focus on Runnable, Minified Engine)

This document defines the requirements for the AIOS (AI Orchestration System), with a clear focus on achieving a runnable, minified, and functionally comprehensive AIOS Engine implemented in Python.

## Key Principle: Executable Code is Paramount

The primary goal is a fully functional AIOS Engine implemented in runnable Python code.  Simulation (using the MVME shell and LLM Orchestrator) is a valuable tool for testing, prototyping, and exploring complex scenarios, but it is *not* a substitute for the deterministic execution of code, especially for tasks involving loops, precise state management, and robust error handling.

## Definitions, Roles, and Responsibilities:

*   **(As defined previously, with added emphasis on the LLM's role in generating *smaller, manageable chunks* of minified code for user assembly and validation.)**

## AIOS Engine Requirements (Target `v5.0mfc` - Runnable, Minified):

The following requirements are targets for the `v5.0mfc` (Minified, Functionally Comprehensive) AIOS Engine, which will be built iteratively through LLM-generated code chunks assembled and validated by the user.

*(Requirements list remains the same as in `v3.0`, with the above clarification added and "conceptual" removed where implied.)*

## Iterative, User-Assisted Minification Process:

1.  **LLM Generates Minified Code Chunks:** The LLM Orchestrator will generate smaller, manageable chunks of minified Python code, starting with the core engine structure and then each MH individually.  These chunks will be designed for syntactic correctness and functional equivalence to the corresponding sections of the verbose `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` script.
2.  **User Assembles and Validates:** The user will assemble these validated chunks into the complete `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc.py` script.  The user is responsible for ensuring the integrated script is syntactically correct and runs without errors.  The MVME shell can be used to test load times of the assembled script.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** If errors are found during testing, the user can provide feedback to the LLM, which can then regenerate the problematic chunk.

This iterative approach leverages the LLM's code generation capabilities for smaller, more manageable units of code, while the user's involvement ensures overall script integrity and functional validation.  This is a collaborative "bootstrapping" process for building the minified engine.
