# AIOS Full Requirements Document v5.0 (Runnable Engine, Iterative Minification)

This document defines the requirements for the AIOS (AI Orchestration System), with a clear focus on achieving a runnable, minified, and functionally comprehensive AIOS Engine implemented in Python through an iterative, user-assisted process.

## Key Principle: Executable, Minified Code is the Target

The primary goal is a fully functional, minified AIOS Engine implemented in runnable Python code.  Simulation (using the MVME shell and LLM Orchestrator) is a valuable tool for testing and prototyping, but the ultimate target is *executable, minified code* that can handle complex logic, loops, and iterations reliably.

## Definitions, Roles, and Responsibilities:

*   **Simulation:**  (As defined before).
*   **Conceptual:** (As defined before).
*   **Executable Code:** (As defined before).
*   **Minified Code:** Python code that has been transformed to reduce its size (character count and token count) while preserving functional equivalence.  This is achieved by shortening names, using abbreviations, and removing unnecessary whitespace or comments.  The goal is to improve parsing performance and reduce load times in execution environments.
*   **User-Assisted Minification:** A collaborative process where the LLM generates smaller, manageable chunks of minified code, and the user assembles and validates these chunks into a complete, runnable script.  This approach leverages the LLM's pattern recognition and code generation capabilities for smaller code sections while relying on the user to ensure overall script integrity and syntactic correctness.

*   **User:** Provides high-level directives, ideas, feedback, assembles and validates minified code chunks, ultimately runs the AIOS Engine on projects.
*   **LLM Orchestrator:** Generates minified code chunks, provides instructions and documentation, simulates complex cognitive tasks (when requested by the *runnable* engine), manages the conceptual state and evolution of the AIOS.
*   **MVME Shell (`A_MVME_v3_4.py`):**  Used for *testing load times* of the assembled, minified script.  Not the primary execution model for simulating full AIOS logic.

## AIOS Engine Requirements (Target `v5.0mfc` - Runnable, Minified):

The following requirements are targets for the `v5.0mfc` (Minified, Functionally Comprehensive) AIOS Engine, which will be built iteratively through LLM-generated code chunks assembled and validated by the user.

*(Requirements list remains the same as in `v4.0`, with the above clarifications added.)*

## Iterative, User-Assisted Minification and Development Process:

1.  **LLM Generates Minified Code Chunks:** (As described before).
2.  **User Assembles and Validates:** (As described before).
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** (As described before).
4.  **Testing:**  The assembled, minified `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc.py` script will be tested by running it directly in the target environment (e.g., Google AI Studio) and verifying its functionality against the requirements.  The MVME shell can be used to assess load time improvements compared to the verbose script.

This iterative, user-assisted approach is crucial for achieving a runnable, minified, and fully functional AIOS Engine, given the current limitations of LLM-driven large-scale code generation.
