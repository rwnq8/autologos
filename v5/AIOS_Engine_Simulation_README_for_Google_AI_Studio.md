**Project:** AIOS Engine Simulation
**Current Date:** (As per our interaction)
**Target Engine Version for Next Session:** `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py`

**0. Google AI Studio Setup (Crucial Prerequisites):**
*   **Environment:** This simulation is designed to be run in **Google AI Studio**.
*   **Enable Code Execution:** Ensure **Code Execution is ENABLED**.
*   **Set Model Parameters for Determinism (Highly Recommended):** Temperature: `0`, Top P: `0.1`, Top K: `1`.
*   **Rationale:** Ensure predictable LLM output if it contributes to generation.

**1. Summary of AIOS Evolution (v3.3.0 to v3.3.2-stateful):**
*   **Initial State:** `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.0.py` (monolithic, duplicates, no state persistence).
*   **Evolution to `v3.3.1-evolved`:** Method deduplication, enhanced startup logging. Key Learning: Studio re-parsing of large scripts caused user-perceived delays, highlighting need for engine state persistence.
*   **Evolution to `v3.3.2-stateful` (Current Target):** Implementation of `export_state()` and `import_state()` to reduce per-turn overhead.

**2. Key Problem Addressed by `v3.3.2-stateful`:**
Unacceptable latency in Google AI Studio from re-parsing large engine script. State management aims to fix this for subsequent turns after initial load.

**3. Roadmap & Vision for AIOS (Long-Term Objectives):**
*   **Overarching Vision:** Highly autonomous, self-improving AIOS for complex goals, content generation, and continuous learning.
*   **Pillar 1: Robust Core Framework & Self-Evolution (FEL-MH)** (State Management, Modular Architecture, Automated FEL Cycle)
*   **Pillar 2: Advanced Meta-Handlers (MHs) & Cognitive Capabilities** (Full MH Implementation, TDE Enhancements)
*   **Pillar 3: Sophisticated CCO Management** (Rich Schema, Advanced Querying, Versioning)
*   **Pillar 4: Enhanced User Interaction & Orchestration** (Adaptive Interaction, Proactive Assistance)
*   **Indicators of Success:** Reduced user intervention, increased task complexity handled, high-quality output, operational efficiency, successful self-evolution, user satisfaction.

**4. Instructions for YOU, THE USER, for the NEW CHAT THREAD (to test `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py`):**
(These instructions are for the original `v3.3.2_stateful.py` and are superseded by the new `README_AIOS_Package_v5.0mfc_conv1.md` for running with the MVME model, but are kept for historical context of the stateful engine's initial testing plan.)
*   Step A: Prepare `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` file.
*   Step B: Start New Chat, Enable Code Execution, Set Model Params.
*   Step C: First Turn - Attach script, instruct AI to instantiate and run `engine.start_engine()`. Expect initial delay. AI will confirm start and provide exported state string.
*   Step D: Subsequent Turns - Re-attach script, provide saved state string, user's choice/input, and conceptual Python steps for orchestrator to call continuation method. Expect faster turns. AI provides new exported state.
