# AIOS Project Package - Simulating v5.0mfc-conv1 (Converged)

This package provides the tools and instructions to simulate the **AIOS Engine v5.0mfc-conv1**. This conceptual version is minified, functionally comprehensive (all MHs implemented with stubs for complex cognition), and possesses advanced autonomous capabilities (stubs for self-evolution).

**Key Principle for This Simulation:**
Due to environmental limitations with large scripts and the LLM's current inability to reliably generate a perfectly minified, fully functional, large-scale Python script in one go without syntax errors, we use a **Minimal Viable Minified Engine (MVME) shell** (`A_MVME_v3_4.py`) for actual Python execution. The LLM Orchestrator (the AI you are chatting with) will then **simulate the rich internal logic and behavior of the conceptual `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc-conv1.py`** (whose detailed logic is based on your `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` plus all conceptual evolutions) through this lightweight MVME shell.

## Package Contents:

1.  **`AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc.py` (Generated in Previous Message):**
    *   The LLM's best attempt at a complete, minified, and syntactically viable Python script for the converged AIOS engine.
    *   **Use with caution:** While generated with diligence, large LLM-generated scripts can still contain subtle errors. It's provided for your review and potential direct execution if you wish to attempt it (expect long load times).
    *   The **recommended simulation path** uses `A_MVME_v3_4.py` below.

2.  **`A_MVME_v3_4.py` (Minified Execution Shell - Recommended for Simulation):**
    *   This is the **Python script you should upload and execute** in Google AI Studio for each interactive turn.
    *   It is very short and loads extremely quickly.
    *   Its internal versioning will be conceptually overridden by the orchestrator to reflect that it's simulating `v5.0mfc-conv1`.

3.  **`AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` (User-Provided Verbose Reference):**
    *   You have this file. It serves as the **source of truth for the detailed, unminified logic** that the `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc.py` is conceptually based on, and which the orchestrator will simulate when you run the `A_MVME_v3_4.py` shell.

4.  **`AIOS_Full_Requirements_Reference.md`**:
    *   Contains the comprehensive AIOS requirements (Pillars 1-4, Core Principles) that you provided earlier. This is the specification against which `v5.0mfc-conv1` was conceptually built and should be evaluated.

5.  **`function_declarations_v3.2.json`**:
    *   Defines the external AI Cognitive Functions that the AIOS Engine orchestrates.

6.  **Schema Files:**
    *   `AIOS_EngineFile_Schema_v1.3.md`
    *   `AIOS_CCO_Schema_v3_0.md`
    *   `AIOS_TID_Schema_v1_2.md`

7.  **Autologos Documentation:**
    *   `autologos_Primer_v0.2.md`
    *   `Internal_Autologos_Specification_v0.2.md`

8.  **Development Roadmap:**
    *   `Improvement_And_Evolution_Pipeline.md`

9.  **`AIOS_Engine_Simulation_README_for_Google_AI_Studio.md`**:
    *   The original README for `v3.3.2_stateful`, retained for historical context on state management and the initial project vision.

10. **`Generated_TID_Backlog_for_v5.0mfc.json`**:
    *   The list of TIDs conceptually generated by `v4.0mfa-auto2` during its self-assessment, representing the backlog for `v5.0mfc-conv1` to have addressed.

## How to Run the AIOS Engine v5.0mfc-conv1 Simulation (Recommended MVME Model):

1.  **Setup Google AI Studio:**
    *   Start a **brand new chat thread**.
    *   Ensure "Code Execution" is **ENABLED**.
    *   Set Model Parameters (Recommended): Temperature to `0`, Top P to `0.1`.

2.  **Turn 1: Starting the MVME Shell (to simulate `v5.0mfc-conv1`):**
    *   **Upload File:** Upload `A_MVME_v3_4.py`.
    *   **Text Prompt:**
        ```text
        Please execute the attached Python script `A_MVME_v3_4.py`.
        After the script definition, please run:
        
        conceptual_version_short = "5.0mfc-conv1"
        conceptual_version_full = f"AIOS_Engine_v{conceptual_version_short} (Converged - Full Logic Simulated by Orchestrator)"
        conceptual_summary = (
            f"MVME simulating {conceptual_version_short}. This version is feature-complete: "
            f"minified, all MHs functional (IFE, PDF, PLAN, TDE with sub-dispatch, CAG, SEL, KAU, FEL), "
            f"advanced MRO, robust error handling, modular design, and autonomous capabilities "
            f"(self-TID generation, conceptual self-code modification)."
        )
        
        mvme_instance = A_MVME() 
        current_engine_output_package = mvme_instance.kernel_start(
            conceptual_engine_version_full=conceptual_version_full,
            conceptual_engine_version_short=conceptual_version_short,
            conceptual_summary=conceptual_summary
        )
        
        print("\\n---FINAL_ENGINE_OUTPUT_PACKAGE_FOR_TURN---")
        print(json.dumps(current_engine_output_package, indent=2))
        ```
    *   **Expected Output:** The MVME will initialize quickly. Its logs and version will reflect that it's simulating `v5.0mfc-conv1`. It will present options like "1. New Process (via conceptual 5.0mfc-conv1)". You will receive its `exported_mvme_state` within the output package.

3.  **Subsequent Turns (User Interacts with MVME, Orchestrator Simulates `v5.0mfc-conv1` Logic):**
    *   **Your Action:** Provide your choice for the MVME (e.g., "NP" for New Process).
    *   **Orchestrator (Me):**
        1.  I will construct a `tool_code` block that loads `A_MVME_v3_4.py`, instantiates it with the `exported_mvme_state` from your previous turn.
        2.  I will call `mvme_instance.kernel_process_choice("YOUR_CHOICE_HERE")`.
        3.  The MVME will return a status (e.g., `ORCHESTRATE_VERBOSE_IFE_START`).
        4.  I will then **verbally narrate and simulate** the detailed steps, internal state changes, and `LLM_REQUEST`s that the **conceptual `AIOS_Engine_v5.0mfc-conv1`** (whose full logic is based on your verbose `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` plus all conceptual evolutions we've discussed) would perform for the corresponding MH.
        5.  At the end of simulating the `v5.0mfc-conv1`'s step, I will update the MVME's `_conceptual_verbose_state_summary` and provide the MVME's new `exported_mvme_state`.

This package provides the tools to simulate the most advanced conceptual version of AIOS we've developed, using a practical method to ensure fast interaction turns.
