# AIOS Full Requirements Document v3.0 (Conceptual `v5.0mfc-final` via MVME Simulation)

This document defines the requirements for the AIOS (AI Orchestration System), with the understanding that these requirements are being *conceptually fulfilled* by a simulated `v5.0mfc-final` engine within the MVME + Orchestrator model.

## Definitions, Roles, and Responsibilities:

*(As defined in the revised README above.)*

## AIOS Engine Requirements (Conceptual `v5.0mfc-final` via MVME Simulation):

*(The following requirements are now understood as being conceptually implemented in `v5.0mfc-final` and simulated by the LLM Orchestrator when using the MVME shell.  The actual Python code for `A_MVME_v3_4.py` only provides a minimal interface and basic state management.  The full logic of `v5.0mfc-final`, including loops, complex cognitive tasks, and advanced features, is simulated by the orchestrator based on the verbose `AIOS_Engine_v3.3.2_stateful.py` script and the conceptual evolutionary changes we've defined.)*

*(Requirements list remains the same as in `v2.0`, with the above clarification added.)*
