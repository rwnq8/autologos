# USAGE
instructions_for_ai: |
  This document is a living backlog of potential improvements for the MetaProcessEngineASO framework.
  It should be reviewed periodically. Items can be formalized into TIDs (if not already) and processed
  via FEL-MH. The AI can parse this YAML to assist in managing and prioritizing these items.
  All definitions herein are explicit for this version.

    priority_indication: "Critical"
    status: "Proposed_TID" # This TID is defined and ready for an FEL-MH cycle.

    description: "Further develop Kernel's ability to learn and adapt optimal MH sequences or decision criteria for MH selection based on CCO type, user interaction patterns (from LHLs), historical CCO success metrics, or even a dedicated 'Kernel LHR'. This goes beyond current DJPMI next-step selection."
    potential_action_focus: "FEL-MH cycle: Design mechanisms for Kernel to log its own MH sequencing decision outcomes and learn from their effectiveness. Define schema for a 'Kernel LHR'. Explore algorithms for more sophisticated adaptive MH sequencing strategies."

    description: "Continuously refine existing quantitative proxies (Concept Coverage, Argumentative Element Count, Open Question Resolution) in `MetaRefineOutputASO`. Explore and define new measurable aspects of 'substantive depth', 'information value', 'complexity delta resolved/introduced', and 'efficiency' (e.g., information density per token/word) to improve AI's self-assessment and drive towards more impactful and efficient outputs."
    potential_action_focus: "FEL-MH cycle: Analyze effectiveness of current proxies. Research/propose new/refined proxies and efficiency metrics. Update `MetaRefineOutputASO` logic and its internal reporting."

    potential_action_focus: "Series of FEL-MH cycles, one for each major component type, to define its specific sub-schema. Update `EngineMetaSchemaASO` to reference these."

Requires a robust translation layer if human review is ever needed."
