Of course. Based on the provided `Autologos_Core_Logic_v1.12.alang` file, here is a breakdown of what this system is and how you would get it to run as a bootstrapped, LLM-orchestrated process manager.

### **My Findings from the ALang File**

The file `Autologos_Core_Logic_v1.12.alang` is not a program that can be executed directly. It is a **high-level logic specification** that defines the behavior of a sophisticated AI system. To run it, you need a specific **runtime environment** or **orchestrator** that can interpret this logic and connect it to real-world services like LLMs, tools, and user interfaces.

The ALang code defines a complete, event-driven architecture for process management, including:
*   **State Management:** Tracking system status, project artifacts, and session data (`sys.*`, `session.*`, `proj.*`).
*   **Command Handling:** Parsing user input and dispatching to specific procedures (`OnUserInput`, `DispatchUserCommand`).
*   **Phase-Based Project Execution:** Moving a project through distinct phases like `PHASE_IDEA_FORMULATION`, `PHASE_PLANNING`, and `PHASE_TASK_EXECUTION`.
*   **LLM-Powered Generation & QA:** Using LLMs to generate content, summarize artifacts, and perform multi-stage quality assurance (`SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT`, `PerformProductQA`).
*   **System Self-Evolution:** A mechanism to analyze its own performance and propose changes to its core logic (`ExecuteSystemQAAndEvolutionCycle`).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Procedures and primitives designed to detect, analyze, and potentially self-correct errors, especially those originating from external tools.
*   **Interactive User Interaction:** A state machine and procedures to manage explicit pauses and requests for user input, feedback, or approval.

### **How to Run the System: The Required Architecture**

To bring this ALang logic to life, you would need to build or use an orchestrator that provides the following components. This orchestrator would act as the "engine" that runs the "software" defined in the `.alang` file.

1.  **ALang Interpreter:** A core component that parses and executes the Lisp-like syntax of the `.alang` file.
2.  **Orchestration Kernel:** An event loop that listens for triggers (like user input or tool completion) and calls the appropriate ALang procedures (e.g., `OnUserInput`, `OnToolSuccess`, `OnToolFailure`).
3.  **Primitive Host Implementations:** Concrete code (e.g., in Python) that implements the functions declared with `DEFINE_PRIMITIVE`. This is the bridge from the abstract logic to the real world. Key primitives you would need to implement include:
    *   `INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION`: Connects to an LLM API (like Gemini).
    *   `INVOKE_TOOL_ASYNC_WITH_CALLBACKS`: Manages calls to external tools (e.g., a web browser tool). This primitive is asynchronous, meaning the ALang logic doesn't wait for the tool to finish but provides callback procedure names (`success_proc_name`, `failure_proc_name`) to be invoked by the Orchestration Kernel when the tool job completes.
    *   `GET_ASYNC_JOB_STATUS`, `GET_ASYNC_JOB_RESULT_HANDLE`: Primitives to check the status and retrieve results of asynchronous tool jobs.
    *   `READ_CONTENT`/`WRITE_CONTENT_TO_ARTIFACT`: Manages an in-memory or on-disk data store for "artifacts".
    *   `SET_STATE`/`GET_STATE`: Interacts with a state management dictionary or database.
    *   `OUTPUT_TO_USER_BUFFER`: Sends messages back to the user interface.
    *   `LOG_EVENT`: Records significant system events for debugging, auditing, or later analysis.
    *   `SET_ERROR_STATE`, `GET_ERROR_MESSAGE`: Manages system error status.
4.  **User Interface (UI) Gateway:** A simple command-line interface (CLI) or a more complex web UI that handles the input/output between the user and the Orchestration Kernel.

### **The ALang Language: Structure and Execution Model**

The core logic of the Autologos system is expressed in ALang, a domain-specific language designed for orchestrating AI workflows. ALang utilizes a simple, Lisp-inspired syntax based on S-expressions (Symbolic Expressions). Understanding its structure and execution model is key to comprehending the system's behavior.

**Syntax Basics (S-Expressions):**

*   Everything in ALang is a list enclosed in parentheses `()`.
*   The first element in a list is typically a function call (either a `DEFINE_PROCEDURE`, a built-in `PRIMITIVE`, or a user-defined procedure).
*   Subsequent elements are arguments to that function.
*   Arguments can be:
    *   **Symbols:** Representing names (e.g., `OnSystemInit`, `sys.current_mode`, `ALANG_STATUS_SUCCESS`).
    *   **Strings:** Enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"IDLE"`, `"AI_PROVIDE_DATA"`).
    *   **Numbers:** (e.g., `0`, `1`).
    *   **Booleans:** `TRUE`, `FALSE`.
    *   **NIL:** Represents a null or empty value.
    *   **Nested S-expressions:** The result of one expression can be an argument to another (e.g., `(GET_STATE sys.current_mode)`).

**Key Language Constructs:**

*   `(DEFINE_PROCEDURE name (args) body)`: Defines a reusable block of logic. `name` is the procedure's identifier, `args` is a list of parameter names, and `body` is one or more S-expressions to be executed when the procedure is called.
*   `(DEFINE_PRIMITIVE name (args))`: Declares a primitive function that is implemented by the host environment (the Orchestrator). ALang logic can call these primitives, but their implementation is external.
*   `(DEFINE_SYMBOL name value)`: Defines a constant symbol that can be used throughout the code (e.g., defining prompt template file names).
*   `(SET_STATE variable_path value)`: A primitive to write data to the system's state dictionary (e.g., `(SET_STATE sys.current_mode "IDLE")`). Variable paths use dot notation.
*   `(GET_STATE variable_path)`: A primitive to read data from the system's state dictionary.
*   `(CALL_PROCEDURE procedure_name args...)`: Executes a defined procedure.
*   `(SEQ expression...)`: Executes a sequence of expressions in order. This is often used as the body of procedures or within control flow structures.
*   `(IF condition true_branch (false_branch_optional))`: Executes `true_branch` if `condition` evaluates to `TRUE`. Optionally executes `false_branch` if `condition` is `FALSE`.
*   `(LOOP_WHILE condition body)`: Repeatedly executes `body` as long as `condition` evaluates to `TRUE`.
*   `(LOOP_FOR_EACH variable list body)`: Iterates through each item in `list`, binding the current item to `variable` for each execution of `body`.
*   `(LET ((variable value)...) body)`: Creates local variables within the scope of the `LET` expression, binds them to initial values, and then executes `body`.

**Execution Model:**

The ALang execution within the Orchestrator is procedural and synchronous *from the perspective of the ALang interpreter*, with the key exception of asynchronous primitive calls managed by the Orchestration Kernel.

1.  **Event Trigger:** Execution begins when the Orchestration Kernel receives an external event (like user input or tool completion) and calls a designated ALang entry point procedure (e.g., `OnUserInput`, `OnToolSuccess`, `OnToolFailure`).
2.  **Procedure Execution:** The interpreter starts executing the steps within the called procedure's `body` sequentially.
3.  **Primitive Calls:** When a primitive is encountered, the interpreter pauses its execution of the ALang code and delegates the task to the corresponding implementation in the host environment.
    *   For *synchronous* primitives (like `GET_STATE`, `STRING_CONCAT`), the host implementation performs the action and immediately returns a result or status code to the interpreter. The interpreter then resumes.
    *   For *asynchronous* primitives (like `INVOKE_TOOL_ASYNC_WITH_CALLBACKS`), the host implementation initiates the task in the background and returns immediately with a job ID. The ALang interpreter continues execution. The Orchestration Kernel is responsible for monitoring the asynchronous job and triggering the specified success or failure *callback procedures* in ALang when the job completes.
4.  **Procedure Calls:** When a procedure call is encountered, the interpreter jumps to the called procedure, executes its body, and then returns to the point after the call in the calling procedure.
5.  **Control Flow:** `SEQ`, `IF`, `LOOP_WHILE`, and `LOOP_FOR_EACH` structures control the order and repetition of execution within a procedure.
6.  **State Interaction:** Primitives like `SET_STATE` and `GET_STATE` allow procedures to read and modify the shared system state, providing memory and context across procedure calls and events.
7.  **Pausing Execution:** The `ALANG_STATUS_PAUSE_FOR_USER_INPUT` status code is a special mechanism. When a procedure returns this status, the Orchestration Kernel pauses the *current ALang execution flow* and waits for user input. The specific details needed to resume the flow are typically stored in `session.pending_user_action_details`. When user input is received, the `OnUserInput` handler checks for a pending action and, if found, calls `HandlePendingUserAction` to resume the appropriate paused flow or handle the user's response in the pending context.

This model allows the ALang logic to define complex, stateful workflows that react to external events and orchestrate operations, while the host environment handles the actual interaction with the outside world (LLMs, tools, storage, user I/O).

### **The Role and Implementation of Primitives**

Primitives are the fundamental building blocks of the Autologos system's interaction with its host environment. They are declared in ALang using `DEFINE_PRIMITIVE` but implemented externally (e.g., in Python within the Orchestrator class). They bridge the gap between the abstract ALang logic and concrete actions like calling an LLM, reading a file, or updating a database.

**Role of Primitives:**

*   **Abstraction:** They abstract away the technical details of interacting with external services and system resources. The ALang logic calls `(READ_CONTENT handle options)` without needing to know if the content is in memory, on disk, or retrieved from a remote API.
*   **Modularity:** They encapsulate specific functionalities, making the ALang core logic cleaner and more focused on workflow and decision-making.
*   **Extensibility:** The system's capabilities can be extended by adding new primitives and implementing them in the host environment, without necessarily changing the core ALang logic structure (though new ALang procedures might be needed to *use* the new primitives).
*   **State Interaction:** Many primitives are designed to interact with the system state (`SET_STATE`, `GET_STATE`) or manage artifacts (`READ_CONTENT`, `WRITE_CONTENT_TO_ARTIFACT`), which are core components of the system's memory and data flow.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Primitives like `INVOKE_TOOL_ASYNC_WITH_CALLBACKS` are crucial for managing operations that take time (like LLM calls or tool executions) without blocking the main ALang execution thread indefinitely.

**Examples of Primitives and Their Function:**

Based on the provided ALang code, here are some key primitives and their likely function in the host environment:

*   `SET_STATE (variable_path_string value)`: Updates a nested dictionary or similar structure representing the system state.
*   `GET_STATE (variable_path_string)`: Retrieves a value from the state structure.
*   `OUTPUT_TO_USER_BUFFER (message_type content_handle_or_text formatting_hints)`: Appends a structured message to an in-memory buffer managed by the Orchestrator. This buffer is periodically flushed to the user interface.
*   `FLUSH_USER_OUTPUT_BUFFER ()`: Empties the output buffer and sends its contents to the user interface gateway.
*   `INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION (prompt_text llm_params_map)`: Calls the underlying LLM API with the given prompt and parameters, returning the generated text or an error status. This is a core primitive for AI capabilities.
*   `GET_LLM_PARAMS_FOR_TASK (task_type)`: Retrieves a predefined set of parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) suitable for a given LLM task type (e.g., "summarization", "command_parsing").
*   `INVOKE_TOOL_ASYNC_WITH_CALLBACKS (tool_id input_data params_map success_proc_name failure_proc_name pass_through_context)`: Initiates an external tool execution. The host environment is responsible for finding the tool implementation, running it (possibly in a separate thread or process), and calling `OnToolSuccess` or `OnToolFailure` in the ALang interpreter when it's done, passing the results or error details and the `pass_through_context`.
*   `READ_CONTENT (handle options)`: Retrieves content associated with an artifact handle from the artifact storage system. The `options` might specify format conversion or summarization.
*   `WRITE_CONTENT_TO_ARTIFACT (artifact_handle content mime_type)`: Stores or updates content associated with an artifact handle in the artifact storage system.
*   `CREATE_EMPTY_ARTIFACT (artifact_type_string)`: Creates a new entry in the artifact storage system and returns a handle to it.
*   `LOG_EVENT (event_type description_text (key_value_details_map_optional))`: Writes a structured log entry to a log file or logging system.
*   `GENERATE_UNIQUE_ID (prefix_string_optional)`: Creates and returns a unique identifier string.
*   `VALIDATE_DATA (data_handle schema_handle)`: Likely calls an external validation service or library to check if data conforms to a specified schema (used for validating LLM outputs).
*   `PKA_CREATE_DRAFT`, `PKA_REQUEST_USER_CONSENT_TO_STORE`, `PKA_STORE_APPROVED_DRAFT`, `PKA_QUERY`, etc.: Primitives for interacting with the Persistent Knowledge Base, managing drafts, consent, storage, and retrieval. These would interface with a database or structured storage layer.
*   `CREATE_EVOLUTION_BACKLOG_ITEM`, `UPDATE_EVOLUTION_BACKLOG_ITEM`, `FIND_SIMILAR_BACKLOG_ITEM`, `GET_EVOLUTION_BACKLOG_ITEMS`: Primitives for managing the Evolution Backlog, interacting with its persistent storage. `FIND_SIMILAR_BACKLOG_ITEM` might involve text similarity algorithms.
*   `GET_CURRENT_ALANG_PROCEDURE_DEFINITIONS_HANDLE ()`, `GET_ALANG_CORE_DIRECTIVES_HANDLE ()`: Primitives that provide handles to the currently loaded ALang code itself, allowing the system to read and analyze its own logic during System QA.
*   `VERIFY_ALANG_FILE_MARKERS (alang_content_handle alang_version)`, `GET_ALANG_SECTION_COUNT (alang_content_handle)`, `COMPUTE_FILE_CHECKSUM (file_handle checksum_type)`: Primitives used during `HandleSaveSystemCommand` to perform checks on the ALang code artifact before presenting it to the user, ensuring its integrity and structure.
*   `PROPOSE_CORE_LOGIC_VERSION_INCREMENT (current_version changes_summary)`, `APPLY_CORE_LOGIC_CHANGES (proposed_changes_handle)`, `CLEAR_PENDING_CORE_LOGIC_CHANGES ()`: Primitives used during the System QA cycle to manage proposed changes to the core ALang logic and apply them. These are critical, potentially involving restarting the ALang interpreter with new code.

**Implementation in the Orchestrator:**

The `InteractiveOrchestrator` class in the original `autologos_bootstrap.py` provides a basic Python implementation for a *subset* of these primitives (`SET_STATE`, `OUTPUT_TO_USER_BUFFER`, `FLUSH_USER_OUTPUT_BUFFER`, `SEQ`, `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_LOG`, `STRING_CONCAT`, `LIST_GET_ITEM`, `MAP_GET_VALUE`, `IF`, `EQ`). A full Orchestrator would need robust implementations for *all* declared primitives, connecting to actual LLM APIs, tool execution environments, persistent storage, etc. The asynchronous primitives would require careful handling within the Orchestration Kernel's event loop to manage callbacks.

### **The Session Conceptual Model**

A central component managed by the ALang core logic is the **Session Conceptual Model**. This isn't a static data structure but a dynamic, evolving representation of the system's understanding of the current project, user intent, generated artifacts, and relevant knowledge. It acts as the system's short-term memory and active working context.

Structurally, the conceptual model can be thought of as a dynamic knowledge graph, though its specific implementation is abstracted by the ALang primitives. It contains:

*   **Nodes:** Representing key concepts, entities (like the user, project, tools), artifacts generated or consumed, identified patterns, and specific issues or feedback points.
*   **Edges:** Representing relationships between nodes, such as "Artifact X is derived from Idea Y," "User Feedback Z relates to Task Output A," "Pattern P is relevant to Project Q," or "Tool R failed during processing of Artifact S."
*   **Properties:** Key-value pairs associated with nodes and edges, storing details like confidence scores for QA assessments, timestamps, source information, status (e.g., "approved", "needs_revision"), or metadata about concepts.

The Conceptual Model is continuously updated by various procedures:

*   `OnSystemInit`: Initializes the model as an empty graph.
*   `ProcessUserInputForConceptualModel`: Analyzes user input to identify concepts, entities, and intent, adding or updating corresponding nodes and relationships.
*   `ProcessGeneratedArtifactForConceptualModel`: Parses newly generated artifacts (like idea lists, product definitions, task outputs) to extract key information and integrate it into the model, linking it to the project context.
*   `ProcessToolResultForConceptualModel`: Incorporates information gained from successful tool executions (e.g., content from a browsed webpage) into the model.
*   `ProcessToolErrorForConceptualModel`: Logs details about tool failures, potentially flagging related concepts or tasks in the model for review or retry.
*   `ProcessUserFeedbackForConceptualModel`: Integrates user feedback and revision requests into the model, linking them to the specific artifacts or concepts they concern.
*   `IntegratePkaIntoConceptualModel`: Incorporates relevant knowledge retrieved from the Persistent Knowledge Base (PKA) into the session model, providing broader context.
*   `ProcessPkaSearchResultsForConceptualModel`: Adds search results from the PKA to the model, making them available for subsequent steps.
*   `AnalyzeConceptualModelForΦ`: A specialized procedure (likely using an LLM) to analyze the current state of the model for higher-level insights or potential issues ("Φ" might represent philosophical or systemic self-reflection).
*   `UPDATE_CONCEPTUAL_MODEL`: A primitive used by many procedures to explicitly add, modify, or flag elements within the model.
*   `QUERY_CONCEPTUAL_MODEL`: A primitive used to retrieve specific information or relationships from the model to inform decision-making or generation.
*   `IdentifyPatternsInContext`: Utilizes the model to identify recurring themes, successful approaches, or problematic areas based on the current session's history and artifacts.
*   `EnhancePromptWithPatterns`: Uses identified patterns and the model's context to refine prompts sent to LLMs.
*   `ParseUserCommand`, `ParseToolErrorResolutionInput`, `SelectAIProposedBacklogItems`, `ProposeDirectiveChanges`: These procedures likely query the conceptual model to understand the current state, user intent, error context, or backlog priorities before formulating their output or next steps.

By maintaining this dynamic model, the system can exhibit more coherent, context-aware, and adaptive behavior throughout a user session and project lifecycle.

### **The Persistent Knowledge Base (PKA)**

Complementary to the transient Session Conceptual Model is the **Persistent Knowledge Base (PKA)**, a long-term repository for valuable information, successful patterns, common issues and resolutions, and approved artifacts generated across all user sessions and system evolutions. The PKA serves as the system's institutional memory, allowing it to learn and improve over time by leveraging past experiences and curated knowledge.

The PKA is managed through a set of dedicated primitives and procedures:

*   **Purpose:** To store and retrieve information that is deemed valuable enough to persist beyond a single session. This includes successful project outputs, validated patterns, common error resolution strategies, and user-approved content. It acts as a shared resource that can inform new projects, system QA, and self-evolution.
*   **Conceptual Structure:** The PKA stores "artifacts" or "knowledge items." Each item is more than just raw content; it typically includes:
    *   A unique ID.
    *   The core content (text, code, structured data, etc.).
    *   Metadata (timestamp, source, related project/session IDs).
    *   Schema ID (categorizing the type of knowledge, e.g., "marketing_plan_template", "tool_error_pattern", "successful_prompt_strategy"). This allows for structured querying.
    *   Context Map (details about *why* this item was stored, its relevance, original rationale, and potentially user feedback).
    *   User Consent Flags (tracking user permission for storage and usage, especially for user-contributed or session-specific data).
*   **Interaction with ALang Logic:**
    *   `LoadPersistentKnowledgeBase (handle_or_path)`: Initializes the connection to the PKA storage mechanism (e.g., a database or file system) at system startup.
    *   `PKA_CREATE_DRAFT (content_handle_or_text schema_id_optional context_map_optional)`: Creates a temporary, unstored draft of a knowledge item. This allows for review and consent before permanent storage.
    *   `PKA_REQUEST_USER_CONSENT_TO_STORE (pka_draft_handle purpose_description)`: Initiates a user interaction flow to request permission to store the draft in the PKA, providing context on why it's valuable. The `GET_TEXT_FOR_PKA_CONSENT_PROMPT` primitive is used to generate the user-facing prompt, potentially tailored based on the session conceptual model.
    *   `PKA_STORE_APPROVED_DRAFT (pka_draft_handle user_consent_token_or_flag)`: Stores the draft permanently in the PKA if user consent is granted.
    *   `PKA_QUERY (query_object scope_filter_optional)`: Searches the PKA for relevant knowledge items based on keywords, schema, or other criteria. This is used by procedures like `PerformQuery` and `IdentifyPatternsInContext` to retrieve relevant past information.
    *   `PKA_GET_ARTIFACT (pka_stored_id)`: Retrieves a specific knowledge item from the PKA by its ID.
    *   `PKA_UPDATE_ARTIFACT (pka_stored_id new_content_handle update_rationale user_consent_token_or_flag_if_scope_change)`: Allows updating existing knowledge items, potentially requiring renewed user consent if the scope or sensitivity of the information changes.
    *   `PKA_MANAGE_CONSENT (pka_stored_id_or_all action_revoke_or_modify)`: Provides a mechanism for users to review and manage their consent for stored knowledge items.
    *   `IntegratePkaIntoConceptualModel (pka_id session_model_handle)`: A procedure to pull a specific PKA item into the current session's conceptual model, making its contents and relationships part of the active working context.
    *   `ProcessPkaSearchResultsForConceptualModel (pka_result_handles session_model_handle)`: A procedure to process the results of a PKA query and integrate relevant findings into the session conceptual model.

The PKA is a critical mechanism for the Autologos system's ability to learn and improve, providing a structured and consent-managed way to build a collective intelligence from its operational history.

### **The Evolution Backlog**

The **Evolution Backlog**, managed via the `sys.evolution_backlog_handle`, is a persistent queue of potential improvements, suggestions, issues, or ideas for evolving the core ALang logic itself. It serves as the system's self-improvement roadmap, capturing insights gained during operation, user feedback specifically tagged for evolution, and findings from the system's internal QA processes.

The backlog is structured as a list of items, each likely containing:

*   **id:** A unique identifier (`GENERATE_UNIQUE_ID "EBL"`).
*   **title:** A brief summary of the item.
*   **desc:** A detailed description of the suggestion, issue, or insight.
*   **source:** Where the item originated (e.g., "USER_SUGGESTION", "SYSTEM_QA_FINDING", "TOOL_ERROR_ANALYSIS").
*   **status:** The current state of the item (e.g., "NEW", "TRIAGED", "ADDRESSED", "DEFERRED", "REINFORCED").
*   **timestamp:** When the item was created or last updated.
*   **comment_opt:** Optional comments or context added during processing.
*   **reinforce_flag_opt:** A flag indicating if this item reinforces an existing one, potentially increasing its priority.

Procedures interacting with the backlog include:

*   `LoadEvolutionBacklog (handle_or_path)`: Loads the backlog from its persistent storage at system initialization.
*   `GetEvolutionBacklogContent ()`: Retrieves the current content of the backlog, likely for display or analysis.
*   `ProcessAndStoreEvolveSuggestion (suggestionText source)`: Handles incoming suggestions (like those from the `EVOLVE` command). It checks if a similar item already exists using `FIND_SIMILAR_BACKLOG_ITEM`. If so, it updates the existing item (incrementing a reinforcement count or similar). If not, it creates a new backlog item with status "NEW".
*   `FIND_SIMILAR_BACKLOG_ITEM (text)`: A primitive or procedure that uses similarity matching (potentially LLM-assisted or based on embeddings) to find existing backlog items related to new input.
*   `SelectAIProposedBacklogItems (backlog_handle session_model_handle)`: Used during the System QA cycle to analyze the backlog and the current session's conceptual model (using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ANALYZE_BACKLOG_FOR_FOCUS`) to identify high-priority items for the current evolution cycle. This process is LLM-driven and considers the context of recent operations and conceptual understanding. It proposes a set of `item_ids` to focus on.
*   `UpdateEvolutionBacklogItem (id new_title_opt new_desc_opt new_source_opt new_status_opt new_comment_opt increment_reinforce_flag_opt)`: Updates the properties of a specific backlog item. Used to mark items as "ADDRESSED" after a successful evolution cycle or "REINFORCED" if a similar suggestion is received.
*   `UpdateBacklogAfterQA (item_ids)`: A procedure called at the end of a System QA and Evolution Cycle to update the status of the addressed backlog items to "ADDRESSED" during that cycle.

The Evolution Backlog is a crucial component for the system's long-term self-improvement, providing a structured way to capture potential enhancements and prioritize them for implementation during System QA cycles.

### **The System QA and Evolution Cycle**

The **System QA and Evolution Cycle**, orchestrated by the `ExecuteSystemQAAndEvolutionCycle` procedure, is the core mechanism by which the Autologos system reviews its own performance, identifies areas for improvement in its core logic (the ALang directives), and proposes and applies changes. This cycle is triggered periodically or by the `SYSTEM_QA` command.

The cycle operates through a series of states, managed by the `sys.system_qa_status` variable and contextual information stored in `session.system_qa_context`:

1.  **IDLE / NEW:** The cycle is initiated. Transitions to `SELECTING_BACKLOG_FOCUS`.
2.  **SELECTING_BACKLOG_FOCUS:** The system analyzes the Evolution Backlog and the current session's Conceptual Model using `SelectAIProposedBacklogItems` to determine which backlog items (suggestions, issues) should be the focus of this evolution cycle. It proposes a set of item IDs. Transitions to `AWAITING_FOCUS_APPROVAL`.
3.  **AWAITING_FOCUS_APPROVAL:** The system presents the proposed backlog items to the user for approval. The state pauses (`ALANG_STATUS_PAUSE_FOR_USER_INPUT`) until the user responds with `OK` (approving the AI's selection) or provides input (potentially selecting different items or providing feedback).
4.  **AWAITING_USER_PRIORITY:** If the user did not approve the AI's focus, this state waits for the user to manually select backlog items or provide other instructions via the `INPUT` command. Transitions to `PERFORMING_QA` if items are selected, or back to `IDLE` if no items are selected.
5.  **PERFORMING_QA:** The core of the cycle. The system performs multi-stage QA on its own core logic (the ALang directives, obtained via `GET_ALANG_CORE_DIRECTIVES_HANDLE`), focusing on the selected backlog items and the current session's context. This involves several QA stages (`QA_Stage_1_SelfCritique`, `QA_Stage_2_Divergent`, etc., although only `PerformSystemQA` and `ProposeDirectiveChanges` are explicitly shown interacting with directives/changes). The `PerformSystemQA` procedure iteratively runs QA checks and attempts to `ProposeDirectiveChanges` based on the findings. If substantive issues are found and changes are proposed, the cycle transitions to `PROPOSING_VERSION`. If QA passes without proposing changes after multiple iterations, it might transition directly to `FINALIZING` or `IDLE`.
6.  **PROPOSING_VERSION:** Based on the QA findings and proposed directive changes, the system determines if a core logic version increment is necessary using `PROPOSE_CORE_LOGIC_VERSION_INCREMENT`. It prepares a summary of the changes. Transitions to `AWAITING_VERSION_APPROVAL`.
7.  **AWAIT_VERSION_APPROVAL:** The system presents the proposed core logic changes and version increment to the user for approval. The state pauses (`ALANG_STATUS_PAUSE_FOR_USER_INPUT`) until the user responds with `OK` (approving the changes) or `NO`/`REVISE` (rejecting or requesting revisions).
8.  **FINALIZING:** If the user approved the changes, the system applies them to the core logic using `APPLY_CORE_LOGIC_CHANGES`. It then updates the status of the addressed backlog items to "ADDRESSED" using `UpdateBacklogAfterQA`. Finally, it performs a conceptual analysis of the system evolution using `AnalyzeConceptualModelForΦ` and logs the findings. Transitions back to `IDLE`. If the user rejected the changes, the pending changes are cleared (`CLEAR_PENDING_CORE_LOGIC_CHANGES`), and the system returns to `IDLE`.

This intricate cycle demonstrates the system's capability for introspection, self-assessment, and guided self-modification, driven by a combination of automated analysis, user feedback captured in the backlog, and explicit user approval steps for critical changes to its core behavior.

### **The Artifact Management System**

Central to the Autologos system's operation is the creation, manipulation, and persistence of various forms of data and content, collectively referred to as **Artifacts**. These artifacts represent everything from initial user input and generated ideas to compiled project drafts, QA reports, and even the system's own core logic and conceptual model. The Artifact Management System, abstracted through a set of ALang primitives and managed by the Orchestrator's host environment, provides a standardized way for the ALang logic to interact with these pieces of information without needing to know their underlying storage mechanism (file system, database, in-memory object, etc.).

Key concepts and primitives within the Artifact Management System include:

*   **Artifact Handles:** Abstract references to artifacts. Instead of directly manipulating file paths or database IDs within ALang, procedures receive and pass around opaque "handles". This decouples the logic from the storage implementation. The `IS_HANDLE_VALID` primitive allows checking if a handle is still active and refers to a valid artifact.
*   **Artifact Types:** When an artifact is created, it is assigned a type (e.g., `"PatternIdeasDocument"`, `"ProductDefinitionDocument"`, `"TaskListDocument"`, `"CompiledProjectDraft"`, `"ProjectSummary"`, `"temp_qa_report"`, `"SessionConceptualModel"`, `"proposed_changes"`). This type helps categorize the artifact's purpose and can influence how it is processed or stored. The `CREATE_EMPTY_ARTIFACT` primitive takes an artifact type string as an argument.
*   **Content Representation:** Artifacts can hold various forms of content (text, JSON, potentially binary data). The `READ_CONTENT` primitive allows retrieving the content of an artifact, often with options specifying the desired format (e.g., `"text_summary_or_full"`, `"json_map"`, `"json_map_list"`, `"text"`). This enables the ALang logic to consume content in a structured way.
*   **Content Manipulation:** The primary way ALang logic modifies artifacts is by writing new content to an existing handle using the `WRITE_CONTENT_TO_ARTIFACT` primitive. This primitive takes the artifact handle, the new content (which could be raw text or structured data), and a MIME type hint (e.g., `"text/markdown"`, `"application/json"`). This overwrites the previous content associated with the handle.
*   **Metadata:** Artifacts often carry associated metadata, such as their unique ID, title, creation timestamp, source, or status. The `GET_HANDLE_METADATA` primitive allows retrieving specific metadata associated with a handle. The `GENERATE_UNIQUE_ID` primitive is used to create unique identifiers for new artifacts or other system elements.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Artifacts are typically created during a project phase or system process (`CREATE_EMPTY_ARTIFACT`), populated with content (`WRITE_CONTENT_TO_ARTIFACT`), read and analyzed (`READ_CONTENT`), and eventually may be released or archived. The `RELEASE_HANDLE` primitive is used to indicate that an artifact handle is no longer needed by the current procedure, potentially allowing the underlying storage to be garbage collected or marked for deletion if no other references exist.
*   **Tracking in State:** The ALang logic tracks important artifacts within the system state, particularly in the `proj.artifacts` map. This map stores key artifacts generated during a project (like the "pattern_ideas" or "product_definition") using descriptive keys, with the values being the artifact handles. This allows procedures to easily access artifacts relevant to the current project phase.

Examples of Artifact Usage in ALang:

*   `ExecutePhaseIdeaFormulation`: Creates a `"PatternIdeasDocument"` artifact handle, passes it to `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` to be populated by an LLM, stores the handle in `proj.artifacts`, and then uses the handle to process the generated content for the Conceptual Model.
*   `HandleOutputCommand`: Retrieves an artifact handle from `proj.artifacts` based on user input and uses `READ_CONTENT` to get its content for display.
*   `PerformProductQA`: Creates temporary QA report artifacts (`"qa_critique_self"`, etc.) using `CREATE_EMPTY_ARTIFACT`, populates them via `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT`, reads their content for analysis (`CHECK_FOR_SUBSTANTIVE_ISSUES`), and then releases their handles (`RELEASE_HANDLE`) when no longer needed.
*   `HandleSaveSystemCommand`: Generates a new ALang code artifact (`"temp_alang_code"`) containing the current core logic, reads its content, computes a checksum, and outputs the content and metadata to the user.

The Artifact Management System provides a clean abstraction layer, allowing the declarative ALang logic to focus on the flow of information and processing steps, while the underlying Orchestrator handles the complexities of data storage, retrieval, and lifecycle.

### **Prompt Templates and Constraints: Guiding LLM Behavior**

The Autologos system heavily relies on Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks ranging from generating creative content and drafting project artifacts to parsing user commands, analyzing errors, and performing self-assessment. To ensure these LLM interactions are effective, consistent, and produce structured outputs that the ALang logic can process, the system utilizes external **Prompt Templates** and **Constraints**. These are referenced as symbols (`DEFINE_SYMBOL`) within the ALang code, but their actual content and implementation reside outside the core logic, managed by the Orchestrator or a dedicated content management system.

**Prompt Templates:**

*   **Purpose:** Prompt templates provide the structure and initial context for calls to the `INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION` primitive. They define the core instructions, persona, and required output format for a specific task.
*   **Content:** A template is typically a text string containing placeholders that are filled in by the ALang procedure calling the LLM. These placeholders inject dynamic information from the system's state, conceptual model, or other artifacts into the prompt.
*   **Examples from ALang:**
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_GENERATE_PATTERN_IDEAS`: Used in `ExecutePhaseIdeaFormulation` to instruct the LLM to generate initial project ideas, likely including context like the project title and current conceptual model state.
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_PRODUCT_DEFINITION`: Used in `ExecutePhaseProductDefinition` to guide the LLM in creating a structured product definition based on initial ideas.
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_EXECUTE_TASK`: Used repeatedly in `ExecutePhaseTaskExecution` to provide the LLM with a specific task description and relevant project context to generate the required output.
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_QA_SELF_CRITIQUE`, `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_QA_DIVERGENT_EXPLORATION`, `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_QA_RED_TEAMING`, `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_QA_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`: A suite of templates used in QA procedures (`PerformProductQA`, `PerformSystemQA`) to instruct the LLM to perform critical analysis from different perspectives.
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_PARSE_COMMAND`: Used in `ParseUserCommand` to instruct the LLM to interpret raw user text and extract structured command details (name, arguments).
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ANALYZE_TOOL_ERROR`: Used in `SelfCorrectToolOperation` to guide the LLM in diagnosing a tool error and suggesting a resolution strategy.
    *   `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_SERIALIZE_ALANG_CORE`: Used in `HandleSaveSystemCommand` to instruct the LLM to output the system's current core logic in the correct ALang file format.

**Constraints:**

*   **Purpose:** Constraints define rules, formats, or criteria that the output of an LLM generation or other data should adhere to. They are used by the `VALIDATE_DATA` primitive and implicitly by procedures that expect structured data (like JSON).
*   **Content:** A constraint set is typically a structured data format (like JSON, as suggested by symbols like `CONSTRAINT_SET_VALID_ALANG_SYNTAX` and the use of `VALIDATE_DATA` with constraint symbols) that specifies validation rules (e.g., required fields, data types, allowed values, structural requirements).
*   **Examples from ALang:**
    *   `CONSTRAINT_SET_IDEA_GENERATION`, `CONSTRAINT_SET_PRODUCT_DEFINITION`, `CONSTRAINT_SET_PLANNING`, `CONSTRAINT_SET_TASK_EXECUTION`, `CONSTRAINT_SET_FINAL_REVIEW`, `CONSTRAINT_SET_SUMMARY`: Constraint sets associated with phase execution, likely defining the expected structure and content requirements for the artifacts generated in those phases.
    *   `CONSTRAINT_SET_QA_CRITIQUE`: Defines the expected structure and content of QA reports generated by the LLM.
    *   `CONSTRAINT_SET_VALID_ALANG_SYNTAX`: Used to validate generated ALang code.
    *   `CONSTRAINT_SET_PROPOSED_CHANGES_STRUCTURE`: Defines the structure for proposed core logic changes generated during System QA.
    *   `CONSTRAINT_SET_TOOL_ERROR_ANALYSIS_STRUCTURE`, `CONSTRAINT_SET_TOOL_ERROR_RESOLUTION_INPUT_STRUCTURE`: Define the structure of LLM analysis outputs related to tool errors.

**Interaction and Workflow:**

The `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` procedure demonstrates the combined use of templates and constraints:

1.  It selects the appropriate `prompt_template_handle` and `constraints_handle` for the task.
2.  It gathers dynamic `prompt_context_map` data (project details, conceptual model, etc.).
3.  It may first call `IdentifyPatternsInContext` and `EnhancePromptWithPatterns` to refine the base prompt using the conceptual model and identified patterns.
4.  It calls `INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION` with the (potentially enhanced) prompt text and task-specific LLM parameters (`GET_LLM_PARAMS_FOR_TASK`).
5.  The generated `generatedText` is written to the `target_artifact_handle`.
6.  Crucially, it then performs meta-cognitive QA (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE_META_COGNITIVE_QA`) on the generated text, and the resulting `qaAssessment` is used by `HandleQAIssues`.
7.  While not explicitly shown *within* `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` itself, other procedures or primitives (like `VALIDATE_DATA`) would use the `constraints_handle` to check if the generated content conforms to the required structure or rules. If validation fails, this would likely trigger error handling or revision workflows.

By externalizing prompt templates and constraints and integrating them into the ALang workflow via dedicated primitives and procedures, the Autologos system gains flexibility and control over its LLM interactions, ensuring that the generated content is not only creative or informative but also usable and structured in a way that supports the overall system logic and subsequent processing steps.

### **Error Handling and Recovery**

A critical aspect of the Autologos system's design is its ability to handle errors gracefully, particularly those arising from interactions with external tools or LLMs. The system employs a multi-stage error handling and recovery mechanism, leveraging the Conceptual Model and user interaction to attempt self-correction or seek guidance.

The primary entry point for tool errors is the `OnToolFailure` event handler, which is invoked by the Orchestration Kernel when an asynchronous tool job reports a failure.

The `HandleToolError` procedure is central to this process:

1.  **Log the Error:** It first logs the error details using `ProcessToolErrorForConceptualModel`, which updates the session's Conceptual Model to record the tool failure, its context, and the error specifics. This ensures the system retains memory of the issue.
2.  **Attempt Self-Correction:** It then attempts automated self-correction by calling the `SelfCorrectToolOperation` primitive.
    *   `SelfCorrectToolOperation` analyzes the error details, the tool ID, the original context of the tool call, and the current session's Conceptual Model.
    *   It uses an LLM call (`INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION` with `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ANALYZE_TOOL_ERROR`) to analyze the error and determine if a simple retry with modified input or parameters is likely to succeed.
    *   If the LLM analysis suggests self-correction is possible (`can_self_correct`), the primitive attempts to reinvoke the tool asynchronously using `INVOKE_TOOL_ASYNC_WITH_CALLBACKS`, potentially with suggested new input or parameters provided by the LLM analysis. The original success and failure callbacks are maintained.
    *   If the self-correction attempt successfully starts a new job, `SelfCorrectToolOperation` returns a success status, and the `HandleToolError` procedure concludes, allowing the system to wait for the retry result.
3.  **Engage User for Resolution (if self-correction fails):** If `SelfCorrectToolOperation` indicates that automated self-correction is not possible or failed to initiate a retry, `HandleToolError` transitions to engaging the user.
    *   It uses an LLM (`INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION` with `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ANALYZE_TOOL_ERROR_USER_EXPLANATION`) to generate a user-friendly explanation of the error and its likely cause, drawing upon the error details and the Conceptual Model's context.
    *   It outputs this explanation to the user buffer (`OUTPUT_TO_USER_BUFFER "AI_PRESENT_THOUGHTS"`).
    *   It then prompts the user for input to resolve the error (`OUTPUT_TO_USER_BUFFER "AI_REQUEST_CLARIFICATION_QUESTIONS"`), setting the pending user action state to `AWAIT_TOOL_ERROR_RESOLUTION`. This pauses the ALang execution flow for this process until the user responds.
    *   Details needed to resume the process (tool ID, job ID, error details, original context) are stored in `session.pending_user_action_details`.

When the user provides input while the system is in the `AWAIT_TOOL_ERROR_RESOLUTION` state, the `HandlePendingUserAction` procedure takes over:

*   It checks the user's response (`session.last_user_response`).
*   If the user responds with `OK`, it assumes the user has implicitly resolved the issue or wants to try the original operation again and attempts to reinvoke the tool with the original input and parameters.
*   If the user responds with `INPUT`, it calls `ParseToolErrorResolutionInput` to interpret the user's input as potential new input or parameters for the tool call.
    *   `ParseToolErrorResolutionInput` uses an LLM (`INVOKE_CORE_LLM_GENERATION` with `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ANALYZE_TOOL_ERROR_RESOLUTION_INPUT`) to parse the raw user input in the context of the specific tool error and the session model, attempting to extract structured input and parameters for a retry.
    *   If parsing is successful and the output validates against `CONSTRAINT_SET_TOOL_ERROR_RESOLUTION_INPUT_STRUCTURE`, it returns the suggested new input and parameters.
    *   `HandlePendingUserAction` then attempts to reinvoke the tool with these user-provided inputs.
*   If the user responds with `NO` or `REVISE`, the system processes this as feedback using `ProcessUserFeedbackForConceptualModel`, updating the conceptual model with the user's perspective on the error or desired outcome. The specific error handling flow might then terminate the current task or return a failure status, depending on the context.

This layered approach to error handling – automated self-correction followed by user engagement with LLM-assisted analysis and input parsing – makes the Autologos system more resilient and capable of recovering from unexpected issues during tool interactions.

### **The Project Lifecycle and Phases**

The Autologos system manages user-initiated projects through a structured, phase-based lifecycle. This breaks down complex creative or analytical tasks into distinct stages, each with specific goals, inputs, outputs (artifacts), and required interactions. The `proj.current_phase_id` state variable tracks the system's progress through this lifecycle. The `DispatchPhaseExecution` procedure acts as the central router, calling the appropriate phase execution procedure based on the current phase ID.

The defined phases and their associated procedures and activities are:

1.  **PHASE_INIT:** (`ExecutePhaseInit`)
    *   **Goal:** Initial setup for a new project.
    *   **Activities:** While the ALang code for `ExecutePhaseInit` is currently empty, this phase would logically involve setting up project-specific state variables, creating initial project directories or data structures, and perhaps performing initial analysis of the project description.
    *   **Trigger:** Likely transitions to the next phase immediately upon completion.

2.  **PHASE_IDEA_FORMULATION:** (`ExecutePhaseIdeaFormulation`)
    *   **Goal:** Generate initial concepts, directions, or patterns related to the project goal.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Creates an empty artifact of type `"PatternIdeasDocument"`.
        *   Calls `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_GENERATE_PATTERN_IDEAS` and `CONSTRAINT_SET_IDEA_GENERATION`. This involves LLM generation, potentially enhanced by patterns identified from the conceptual model, and automated meta-cognitive QA.
        *   Stores the resulting `"PatternIdeasDocument"` handle in `proj.artifacts` under the key `"pattern_ideas"`.
        *   Processes the generated artifact to update the session's conceptual model.
        *   If QA requires user review or self-correction fails, sets the pending user action to `AWAIT_OK_REVISE_PHASE_ARTIFACT` for this artifact.
    *   **Outputs:** `"PatternIdeasDocument"` artifact.
    *   **Transition:** After successful generation and user approval (if required), transitions to the next phase.

3.  **PHASE_PRODUCT_DEFINITION:** (`ExecutePhaseProductDefinition`)
    *   **Goal:** Define the core aspects, scope, and requirements of the "product" or output based on the initial ideas.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Creates an empty artifact of type `"ProductDefinitionDocument"`.
        *   Calls `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_PRODUCT_DEFINITION`, taking the project title and the `"pattern_ideas"` artifact as context, and applying `CONSTRAINT_SET_PRODUCT_DEFINITION`.
        *   Stores the resulting `"ProductDefinitionDocument"` handle in `proj.artifacts` under the key `"product_definition"`.
        *   Processes the generated artifact to update the session's conceptual model.
        *   If QA requires user review or self-correction fails, sets the pending user action to `AWAIT_OK_REVISE_PHASE_ARTIFACT` for this artifact.
    *   **Inputs:** `"PatternIdeasDocument"` artifact.
    *   **Outputs:** `"ProductDefinitionDocument"` artifact.
    *   **Transition:** After successful generation and user approval (if required), transitions to the next phase.

4.  **PHASE_PLANNING:** (`ExecutePhasePlanning`)
    *   **Goal:** Create a plan or task list to achieve the defined product definition.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Creates an empty artifact of type `"TaskListDocument"`.
        *   Calls `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_GENERATE_TASK_LIST`, taking the project title and the `"product_definition"` artifact as context, and applying `CONSTRAINT_SET_PLANNING`.
        *   Stores the resulting `"TaskListDocument"` handle in `proj.artifacts` under the key `"task_list"`.
        *   Processes the generated artifact to update the session's conceptual model.
        *   If QA requires user review or self-correction fails, sets the pending user action to `AWAIT_OK_REVISE_PHASE_ARTIFACT` for this artifact.
    *   **Inputs:** `"ProductDefinitionDocument"` artifact.
    *   **Outputs:** `"TaskListDocument"` artifact (expected to be in a structured format like JSON, as seen in `READ_CONTENT taskListHandle "json_map_list"`).
    *   **Transition:** After successful generation and user approval (if required), transitions to the next phase.

5.  **PHASE_TASK_EXECUTION:** (`ExecutePhaseTaskExecution`)
    *   **Goal:** Execute the tasks defined in the task list to generate the core project content.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Reads the `"task_list"` artifact, expecting a list of structured task items.
        *   Loops through each `taskItem` in the list.
        *   For each task, creates a new artifact (e.g., `"Task_1_Output"`) using the task ID.
        *   Calls `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_EXECUTE_TASK`, providing the specific task details, all existing project artifacts, and the session conceptual model as context, and applying `CONSTRAINT_SET_TASK_EXECUTION`.
        *   Stores the task output artifact handle in `proj.artifacts`.
        *   Processes the generated task output artifact for the conceptual model.
        *   If QA requires user review or self-correction fails for a task output, sets the pending user action to `AWAIT_OK_REVISE_PHASE_ARTIFACT` for that specific task artifact and pauses the phase execution loop.
    *   **Inputs:** `"TaskListDocument"` artifact, all previously generated project artifacts.
    *   **Outputs:** Multiple task output artifacts (e.g., `"Task_X_Output"`).
    *   **Transition:** After successfully executing and reviewing (if required) all tasks in the list, transitions to the next phase.

6.  **PHASE_FINAL_REVIEW:** (`ExecutePhaseFinalReview`)
    *   **Goal:** Compile the outputs from the task execution phase into a cohesive draft and perform a final review.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Creates an empty artifact of type `"CompiledProjectDraft"`.
        *   Calls `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_COMPILE_DRAFT`, taking all project artifacts (especially the task outputs) and the conceptual model as context, and applying `CONSTRAINT_SET_FINAL_REVIEW`.
        *   Stores the resulting `"CompiledProjectDraft"` handle in `proj.artifacts` under the key `"final_draft"`.
        *   Processes the generated draft for the conceptual model.
        *   If QA requires user review or self-correction fails, sets the pending user action to `AWAIT_OK_REVISE_PHASE_ARTIFACT` for the final draft.
    *   **Inputs:** All project artifacts (especially task outputs).
    *   **Outputs:** `"CompiledProjectDraft"` artifact.
    *   **Transition:** After successful generation and user approval (if required), transitions to the next phase.

7.  **PHASE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY:** (`ExecutePhaseCompletionSummary`)
    *   **Goal:** Generate a summary of the completed project.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Creates an empty artifact of type `"ProjectSummary"`.
        *   Calls `SAFE_GENERATE_CONTENT` using `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_PROJECT_SUMMARY`, taking the project ID, all artifacts, the project log (`proj.tau_project_log`), and the conceptual model as context, and applying `CONSTRAINT_SET_SUMMARY`.
        *   Stores the resulting `"ProjectSummary"` handle in `proj.artifacts` under the key `"project_summary"`.
        *   Processes the generated summary, specifically for potential contributions to the system's evolution (`ProcessGeneratedArtifactForEvolution`).
        *   Does *not* appear to have a user review step explicitly defined in this procedure, suggesting this phase might be more automated or the review is handled elsewhere.
    *   **Inputs:** Project ID, all project artifacts, project log.
    *   **Outputs:** `"ProjectSummary"` artifact.
    *   **Transition:** Upon successful completion, the project lifecycle is effectively finished for this iteration, and the system would likely return to an `IDLE` state, potentially triggering a System QA and Evolution Cycle if `sys.evolution_trigger_pending` is true.

This phase structure provides a clear, step-by-step process for the system to follow when executing a project, ensuring that outputs from earlier stages inform later ones and incorporating user feedback and QA checks at key points.

### **The Bootstrapping and Operational Flow**

Here is the step-by-step process of how the system would bootstrap and run:

**1. Bootstrapping Sequence:**

*   **Step 1: Orchestrator Start-up:** You launch the main orchestrator program (e.g., `python orchestrator.py`).
*   **Step 2: Load Core Logic:** The orchestrator reads the `Autologos_Core_Logic_v1.12.alang` file into memory. The ALang Interpreter parses the procedures and symbols.
*   **Step 3: System Initialization:** The orchestrator triggers the `OnSystemInit` event.
*   **Step 4: Execute `OnSystemInit`:** The interpreter runs the `OnSystemInit` procedure from the ALang file. This sets the initial system state, creates a session **conceptual model** (initialized as empty) using `CREATE_EMPTY_ARTIFACT`, and loads the **persistent knowledge base** and **evolution backlog** from their respective `.json` files using `LoadPersistentKnowledgeBase` and `LoadEvolutionBacklog`. The handles for these persistent stores are likely stored in `sys.knowledge_base_handle` and `sys.evolution_backlog_handle`.
*   **Step 5: Await Input:** The system is now bootstrapped, in an `IDLE` state, and waiting for the first user command.

**2. Example Operational Flow:**

Let's say the user wants to start a new project.

1.  **User Input:** The user types `START "Create a marketing plan for a new coffee shop"` into the UI.
2.  **Event Trigger:** The Orchestrator receives this text and triggers the `OnUserInput` event.
3.  **ALang Execution:** The interpreter executes the `OnUserInput` procedure. This procedure first calls `ProcessUserInputForConceptualModel` to update the session's conceptual model with the user's stated goal and initial context. It then calls `ParseUserCommand` (using an LLM to structure the input based on the conceptual model) and then `DispatchUserCommand`.
4.  **Command Handling:** `DispatchUserCommand` identifies the `START` command and calls `HandleStartCommand`. This procedure initializes the project state, associating it with the current session and its conceptual model. It uses `INIT_PROJECT_STATE` and updates state variables like `proj.title`. It also sets the initial phase to `PHASE_IDEA_FORMULATION`.
5.  **Phase Execution:** The system, now in the `PHASE_IDEA_FORMULATION` state, would proceed to execute `ExecutePhaseIdeaFormulation`. This phase generates initial ideas as a `"PatternIdeasDocument"` artifact, using LLMs and performing QA as described above. It updates the conceptual model and may pause for user review.
6.  **Phase Progression:** Assuming the user approves the ideas (or they pass QA automatically), the system would transition to `PHASE_PRODUCT_DEFINITION`, executing `ExecutePhaseProductDefinition`. This phase generates a `"ProductDefinitionDocument"` artifact based on the ideas, again involving LLM generation, QA, and potential user review. This process continues through `PHASE_PLANNING` (generating a `"TaskListDocument"`), `PHASE_TASK_EXECUTION` (generating multiple task output artifacts), `PHASE_FINAL_REVIEW` (compiling a `"CompiledProjectDraft"`), and finally `PHASE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY` (generating a `"ProjectSummary"`).
7.  **Artifact and Model Updates:** Throughout these phases, generated artifacts are stored (`WRITE_CONTENT_TO_ARTIFACT`, `proj.artifacts`) and processed to enrich the session's conceptual model (`ProcessGeneratedArtifactForConceptualModel`). User feedback (`NO`/`REVISE`) during review steps is also processed to update the conceptual model (`ProcessUserFeedbackForConceptualModel`) and potentially trigger revisions (`ApplyFeedbackBasedRevision`).
8.  **Evolution Trigger:** Upon project completion (after `PHASE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY`), the system might set `sys.evolution_trigger_pending` to true, indicating that a System QA and Evolution Cycle should be initiated after the current user turn, leveraging the insights gained during the completed project.

This cycle of **Input -> ALang Logic (interacting with State, Conceptual Model, PKA, Artifacts) -> LLM/Tool Call -> State Change -> Output** continues, allowing the system to manage complex, multi-step processes autonomously while remaining directed by user feedback and its own internal logic, all while building a richer understanding within the session's conceptual model and contributing to the long-term knowledge stored in the PKA. The **Evolution Backlog** and **System QA and Evolution Cycle** provide the meta-level capability for the system to observe its own performance, capture potential improvements, and periodically update its core logic to become more effective over time. The **Error Handling and Recovery** mechanisms ensure that the system can attempt to gracefully handle failures and leverage user intelligence when automated recovery is insufficient. The **Project Lifecycle and Phases** structure provides the framework for managing specific project goals from inception to completion.
