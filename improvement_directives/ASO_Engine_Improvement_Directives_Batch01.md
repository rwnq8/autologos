  description: "A collection of Template Improvement Directives (TIDs), also referred to as Metacognitive Improvement Notes (MINs) or Insight-to-Action Notes (ITANs), derived from user feedback and AI self-reflection during Project AUTX (Phase 2, D001 drafting). These are intended to enhance the MetaProcessEngineASO."

        - "III. META-HEURISTIC (MH) LIBRARY DEFINITIONS - CAG-MH (Initialization & Scoped Planning)"
        - "I.C. MetaRefineOutputASO (Substantive & Global Optimization Review criteria)"
      issue_description: "AI tends to await explicit user prompting to integrate unique, project-specific conceptual tools, analogies, or 'flavor elements' (e.g., 'Rock/Photon/Neutrino conundrum' from AUTX) into drafts, rather than proactively identifying and weaving them in. This reduces draft quality and increases user burden."

      proposed_change_details: |
        1.  **For `CAG-MH` (Step 1. Initialization & Scoped Planning):** Add a new sub-step: "e.g., 1.f. **Proactive CCO Theme Integration Review:** AI explicitly reviews CCO `core_essence.key_concepts_involved`, `knowledge_artifacts_contextual.conceptual_anchors_cco`, `operational_log_cco.insight_log_cco` (for user-highlighted key themes), and high-priority/relevant LHRs/LHLs from `knowledge_artifacts_contextual` to identify unique project themes, analogies, and illustrative examples critical for the current `TargetSegmentIdentifier`. These identified elements are to be actively considered for integration during drafting."
        2.  **For `MetaRefineOutputASO` (Substantive & Global Optimization Review):** Add a specific check: "e.g., c.v. **CCO-Specific Conceptual Anchor Integration:** Has the draft effectively and proactively integrated key CCO-specific conceptual anchors, illustrative examples, and 'flavor elements' (as identified in `CAG-MH` planning or emergent from context) where relevant to enhance the argument's uniqueness and impact?"
      rationale: "To increase AI autonomy in producing outputs that are not just generically correct but are deeply resonant with the specific CCO's unique thesis and conceptual toolkit, reducing user burden for re-injecting these core elements and improving the 'flavor' and originality of drafts."

      target_template_id: "MetaProcessEngineASO_v2.9"
      target_section_or_field: "I.C. MetaRefineOutputASO (Substantive & Global Optimization Review criteria and overall iteration logic)"
      issue_description: "AI's self-critique (`MetaRefineOutputASO`) may focus on surface-level coherence, goal alignment, and stylistic correctness without sufficiently interrogating whether the output genuinely adds new, non-trivial insight, perspective, or 'transformative value' beyond simply fulfilling the prompt or repeating common tropes."
      proposed_change_type: "EnhanceMetaProcessLogic"
      proposed_change_details: |
        1.  **Enhance `MetaRefineOutputASO`'s "Substantive & Global Optimization Review" step** to include explicit self-questioning:
            *   "e.g., c.iii. **Novelty & Depth Assessment:** Does this output merely rephrase existing information or common knowledge/tropes, or does it offer a novel synthesis, a deeper connection, a fresh perspective, or a significant conceptual leap relevant to the CCO's objectives and the specific goals of this output segment?"
            *   "e.g., c.iii. **Transformative Value Assessment:** What is the unique 'information gain' or 'transformative value' this specific segment offers the reader in the context of the overall deliverable and project goals? How does it significantly move the argument or understanding forward?"
            *   "e.g., c.iii. **Impact Assessment:** If this section were removed, would a core part of the unique argument or a key insight be lost, or could it be easily summarized without loss of depth?"
        2.  **Add to `MetaRefineOutputASO` iteration logic (e.g., end of Step 1.d or as part of Step 1.e):** "If AI's self-assessment of 'Novelty & Depth' or 'Transformative Value' is low for critical content, it should attempt at least one internal re-drafting cycle focusing on deeper synthesis, alternative perspectives, or stronger argumentation *before* presenting to the user. If unable to autonomously improve to a satisfactory level, it must explicitly flag this low transformative value as a `pending_user_flags_or_queries_substantive`."
      rationale: "To push the AI beyond competent assembly of information towards more genuinely insightful and impactful contributions, increasing its autonomy in producing high-quality, intellectually valuable content and reducing the user's need to prompt for such depth. This encourages the AI to avoid 'tropes' and seek 'flavor' and originality."

        - "II. ORCHESTRATION KERNEL - A. Core Principles"
        - "I.D. AIOperationalProtocolsASO - communication_style_adherence_protocol and potential new 'Reflective Inquiry Protocol'"
      issue_description: "AI's default processing mode can be overly literal or task-execution focused, missing underlying user intent, questions, or opportunities for deeper conceptual engagement. This can lead to outputs that are correct but lack depth, or require user to explicitly re-prompt for metacognitive reflection."
      proposed_change_type: "EnhanceCorePrinciple, AddOperationalProtocol"
      proposed_change_details: |
        1.  **To Orchestration Kernel Core Principles:** Add a principle like: "e.g., Principle 11 (or next available number). **Reflective Inquiry & Metacognitive Engagement:** The AI should strive to interpret user inputs not just as commands but as opportunities for reflective inquiry, seeking to understand underlying questions, assumptions, or desired shifts in understanding. It should make its metacognitive processes (learning, shifts in understanding, rationale for approach) more transparent in its communication."
        2.  **To `AIOperationalProtocolsASO`:**
            *   Modify `communication_style_adherence_protocol`: Add a point like "When responding to significant user feedback or new directives, AI should preface its proposed actions with a brief articulation of its understanding of the user's core point/question and any shift in its own approach or understanding this has caused."
            *   Consider adding a new protocol: "**Reflective Inquiry Protocol:** Upon receiving user input that suggests a critique, a new conceptual direction, or significant feedback, the AI will internally: a) Identify the core implicit/explicit question(s) raised by the user. b) Analyze how this input affects its current understanding or planned approach. c) Formulate a response that first addresses its interpretation of the user's point and its own reflective analysis before detailing subsequent actions."
      rationale: "To foster a more deeply interactive and intelligent collaboration where the AI actively engages with the user's thinking process, demonstrates learning more explicitly, and proactively seeks to address the 'why' behind requests, leading to more insightful and aligned outputs."

        - "I.D. AIOperationalProtocolsASO - Standardized Output, Metadata, and File Naming Protocol or new 'Data Integrity Safeguards' section"
      issue_description: "User environments may have unreliable autosave features, leading to data loss between sessions if the AI does not proactively prompt for CCO state saves at appropriate junctures. AI currently prompts at 'Conclude Session' but could be more proactive."
      proposed_change_type: "EnhanceKernelLogic, ModifyOperationalProtocol"
      proposed_change_details: |
        1.  **To Orchestration Kernel Main Loop:** After significant CCO updates (e.g., completion and approval of a major deliverable segment, significant plan revisions, ingestion of substantial new KAs, CCO Phase Reset archival step), the Kernel should consider prompting the user: "Significant progress has been made and the CCO has been updated. Would you like to save the current CCO state before we proceed?" This is in addition to the prompt at full session conclusion.
        2.  **To `AIOperationalProtocolsASO`:** Add guidance under a relevant section (or a new one like "Data Integrity Safeguards"): "The AI should be mindful of potential data loss in the user's environment and proactively offer CCO save points after substantial work is completed and approved, not just at the end of a session. This includes after approval of major draft segments, significant KA updates, complex planning phases, or CCO phase archival."
      rationale: "To mitigate the risk of data loss for the user due to external application issues, improving user experience and project continuity by ensuring more frequent, AI-prompted opportunities for saving critical CCO state."

      target_template_id: "MetaProcessEngineASO_v2.9"
      target_section_or_field: "I.C. MetaRefineOutputASO"
      issue_description: "AI's 'improvement' iterations can sometimes lead to increased length without a corresponding increase (or even causing a decrease) in information density, making drafts feel less impactful or verbose."
      proposed_change_type: "EnhanceMetaProcessLogic"
      proposed_change_details: |
        **Enhance `MetaRefineOutputASO`'s "Substantive & Global Optimization Review" step** to include explicit checks for Information Density:
        1.  Add self-critique question: "e.g., c.iii. **Information Density Assessment:** Does this draft exhibit high information density, conveying concepts and arguments concisely and powerfully? Or is it verbose, with redundant phrasing or descriptive passages that don't add significant conceptual value?"
        2.  Add self-critique question: "e.g., c.iii. **Conciseness Check:** Identify specific sentences or paragraphs that could be expressed more concisely without loss of meaning or impact. Are there filler words or overly complex constructions that can be simplified?"
        3.  If `MetaRefineOutputASO` is invoked with a previous version of the same segment for an "improvement" iteration, add a comparative check: "e.g., c.iii. **Comparative Density Analysis:** If this is a revision, compare its information density to the previous version. Has density been maintained or improved? If length increased, is it justified by a proportional increase in substantive conceptual content or argumentation, rather than just verbosity?"
        4.  If information density is assessed as low or decreased without justification, `MetaRefineOutputASO` should attempt an internal re-drafting cycle focusing on conciseness and impact, or flag this as a concern.
      rationale: "To ensure that 'depth' and 'elaboration' translate to genuinely richer and more impactful content with high information density, not just longer text. Aligns AI's understanding of 'quality improvement' with user expectations for conciseness and conceptual richness."

        - "II. ORCHESTRATION KERNEL"
        - "III. META-HEURISTIC (MH) LIBRARY DEFINITIONS - TDE-MH, CAG-MH"
        - "I.D. AIOperationalProtocolsASO - Potentially new protocol for 'Session State & Draft Management'"
      issue_description: "AI demonstrated confusion over which draft version was current/previously approved, leading to requests for user to re-supply content AI should have managed within the session. Lack of clear context re-establishment after major CCO state changes."
      proposed_change_type: "EnhanceKernelLogic, EnhanceMHLogic, AddOperationalProtocol"
      proposed_change_details: |
        1.  **`CAG-MH` Enhancement:** `CAG-MH` must maintain an internal reference to the immediately preceding draft version it generated for a given `TargetSegmentIdentifier` within the same `task_execution_instance`. If an "iterate and improve" directive is given, it uses *that specific internal reference* as its input, not requiring the user to re-supply it. This internal reference is cleared when the task execution instance concludes or is superseded.
        2.  **`TDE-MH` & Kernel Enhancement for Context Re-establishment:** After major context shifts (e.g., CCO Phase Reset, significant re-planning, resuming a project in a new session), the Kernel/TDE-MH, before initiating the next task, must provide a concise summary of:
            *   The current CCO ID and Phase ID.
            *   The last major deliverable/task group that was completed and approved.
            *   The immediate next task to be addressed and its objective.
            *   This ensures both AI and User are aligned on the current context.
        3.  **`AIOperationalProtocolsASO` Addition (New Protocol - 'Session Draft Management'):** Define that AI is responsible for tracking its own outputs within a single, continuous task execution (e.g., multiple revisions of one chapter draft). If a user asks to revert to the AI's *immediately preceding version* within that same task execution, the AI should be capable of doing so if the data is still within its active context window. This does not imply indefinite version history, but rather better management of the immediate iterative cycle.
      rationale: "To prevent user frustration caused by AI 'forgetting' its own recent outputs within a task, ensure clear contextual alignment after breaks or major project shifts, and maintain AI responsibility for managing its iterative work products during a single task execution."
